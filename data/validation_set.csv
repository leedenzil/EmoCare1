1og4kjw,"An in-depth analysis on everything Upside Showdown does wrong, and how to fix it","TL;DR at the bottom

Hey everyone, I'm a longtime Brawl Stars player who also happens to play a lot of roguelites. Before I begin, I'll dump a few qualifications to prove that I know what I'm talking about. I have a winstreak of 3 on A20H in Slay the Spire, C+ in Balatro, and all combinations divine victory in Monster Train. So I'm pretty good at roguelites.

I have quite a few criticisms about the new Upside Showdown mode announced in today's Brawl Talk, and I want to talk about them here, to explain exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

# Part 1: Metaprogression and Unlocks

A lot of roguelites feature some sort of unlock or metaprogression system---when you first start playing the game, you won't have access to all possible abilities and you won't be at your full power.

For the sake of this post, I'll define ""unlocks"" as abilities that you won't be able to get when you first play the game, but you'll be able to permanently unlock them after doing certain things and you will be able to encounter them in future runs (e.g. card and relic unlocks in Slay the Spire). ""Metaprogression"" is a way to permanently buff the playable character(s) that carries in between runs (e.g. upgrades and golden eggs in Vampire Survivors). 

However, basically every good roguelite follow a few principles for metaprogression.

Firstly, any and all unlocks are guaranteed. What this means is that all unlockable abilities are unlocked by the same requirements no matter what. In Monster Train, for example, the score that you get for each run is converted into XP, which will level up the clans that you finished that run with. Each level for each clan unlocks a fixed set of cards and relics that you will be able to find in your future runs. There is zero randomness in the system.

Secondly, the player has a choice in their metaprogression. In other words, the player chooses what buffs they grant to which character. In Vampire Survivors, for example, the player can choose which upgrades to purchase using gold they earn in each run. The player also chooses which playable character they can assign golden eggs. 

Thirdly, all unlocks and metaprogression are ""grindable."" If the player plays infinitely, they will be able to acquire all unlocks and permanent upgrades. Moreover, almost all roguelikes also allow the player to unlock fast. Slay the Spire requires you to play 3-4 runs with each of the 4 characters to earn enough XP to unlock everything. Each run takes maybe 45 minutes.

All three of these are necessary to make a roguelite fun. Players don't want to have their abilities gated behind RNG; it's frustrating and unfun. Players also want to have the ability to unlock all their abilities through playing the game---only being able to unlock, say, 1 ability per day is incredibly annoying and limits what the player can do. 

Brawl Stars happens to do *none* of these three. There doesn't appear to be any metaprogression in Upside, so I'll ignore that for now, but the cards that players choose in-game are unlocked through card packs that are purchased with waffles, which are a limited currency (unless, of course, you shell out real money). Players will be able to play with a limited selection of abilities, which greatly restricts the freedom they have when choosing brawlers and builds (although due to other reasons, this might not even be relevant, and not in a good way).

# Part 2: PvP

The roguelite genre in general is often criticized as being too RNG-based. People often claim that roguelites require no skill and that you often get ""unwinnable runs"" and that they got screwed over by RNG.

However, this is not true. (For most roguelites, at least.) What makes roguelites not RNG-based is the fact that *roguelites are PvE.* This means that players will always know what possible enemies and bosses are coming, and how to prepare for it. More importantly, however, the player knows how strong they have to be. They don't have to become some unkillable god that can basically stand still and win---they can barely scrape their way through with the help of consumable items and intense micro, and in either case, it counts as a victory.

I'll use Slay the Spire as such an example. For reference, StS is a notably hard game. Around two-thirds of all people who download the game ever win a single run. Around 16% of the players reach Ascension 10, and less than 8% of all players ever beat Ascension 20, the highest difficulty in the game. Slay the Spire also has an optional superboss called the Heart that is not only more difficult than any other fight in the game by a long shot, but also requires the player to give up one card upgrade, one relic, and fight an extra-dangerous elite fight. Around 15% of players have beaten this boss at any difficulty. In other words, A20H (Ascension 20 Heart) is extremely difficult. There aren't any statistics on how many people have beaten it, but it's probably less than 5%. The players who did beat it also probably took many attempts--it's known that the A20 no heart winrate is less than 10%, so A20H is most likely even lower. Again, I don't have the exact numbers, but I do know that it took me 32 attempts to beat A20H when I first attempted, so maybe around 3%. 

Despite this difficulty, despite all the criticism of the game for being too difficult, it is still almost always winnable with perfect play. The best player in the world has achieved a winstreak of 26 on A20H while rotating between all four characters, and someone has achieved a winstreak of 53 (and still going!) with the Watcher, which is generally considered the strongest of the four characters. In fact, it took over four years to find the first truly unwinnable seed in Slay the Spire, and that is only unwinnable on Ascension 18 or above, and only on one of the four characters.

The point of the last two paragraphs was that roguelites aren't RNG-based---because the enemies you fight are fixed, because almost all roguelites are PvE, you can prepare for them in advance and know what abilities are most suited.

Brawl Stars is a PvP game, however, and this means that the roguelite mode is in fact completely RNG-based. You no longer have to reach a fixed bar---instead, you have to make sure that you are better than six of the nine other players in your lobby. And this is completely out of your control. You can make the best decisions and the best play at every possible moment and still lose, sometimes in crushing fashion. And that just isn't fun. 

Brawl Stars is a skill-based game. If you are mechanically better than your enemies and you draft properly, you have a very good chance at winning. Roguelites are mostly skill-based games. If you make the best decision at each point in time, or at least a reasonably good one, you will most likely win your run. However, Upside Showdown, a multiplayer PvP roguelite gamemode in Brawl Stars, is not a skill-based game. You can be the best player in your lobby, pick the best cards at every point in time, and you can still lose because someone else got luckier and was offered a better set of cards. 

If that isn't bad enough, recall the set of abilities you are able to encounter is already determined by RNG, so you don't have to deal with one layer of randomness when fighting others, you have to deal with two. Per player. You have to not only unlock cards that are strong enough and synergize with each other but also make sure that you find them when playing and that your enemies don't have a stronger combo.

Upside Showdown tries to appeal to both the Brawl Stars audience and the roguelite audience, and somehow it does neither. Brawl Stars players seek a game of mechanical skill---but is it really skilled if your enemy who has twice your hitpoints and twice your damage kills you? Roguelite players seek a game that rewards good decision-making---but it doesn't matter how good the choices you make are if your enemy has triple your stats.

# Part 3: What Makes Roguelites Fun

I touched on this a bit in part 2, but fundamentally, what makes roguelites fun is the decision making. Roguelites give the player some subset of options and the player makes their choice from that. Good choices are rewarded with synergy and stronger builds that allow the player to win fights more easily. Bad choices are punished when the player isn't strong enough to keep up with the enemies.

Thus, every good roguelite makes sure that the player has a lot of freedom. Perhaps the game is mostly random, but the game usually finds some way to allow the player to mitigate that randomness to some extent. Slay the Spire allows the player to choose their path, thus dictating when they fight, when they upgrade, when they get relics, and when they get a shop. Balatro allows players to reroll the shop to give more possible options of jokers and cards and gives consumable items that the player can use to permanently modify their deck in certain ways. Roguelites, while partially RNG-based, must also make sure that the player has *some* agency, some way to reduce randomness, so that they can win.

Brawl Stars does no such thing. In your entire run, you are offered five decisions, and each decision has only three options. It doesn't appear that you can reroll the options either---you just have to take what you get and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no path to change what you can do, no reroll to give you new choices, no ban to ensure that you can't see a certain upgrade. And again, the abilities that you can find in a run aren't even chosen by you; they're chosen by a random card pack. So the player has barely any freedom to choose their build and they're almost entirely at the mercy of RNG, which is just not fun.

# Conclusion

I have two proposed solutions to these problems.

If Brawl Stars wants to keep the mode as PvP, make the unlock system guaranteed. Instead of card packs, make it a shop where players can buy exactly what card they want using waffles. Or make it so that card packs drop the same rewards every time, fixed. Find some way to level the playing field so that all players have the same unlocks.

They can also make it so that the player faces some boss fight instead of players. We just got a great series of bosses in the Halloween event, with some fine-tuning and different difficulties we could have players face these bosses instead. The RNG-based unlocks would also be less of a problem because the players now know what they're fighting and can prepare for them.

In both cases, GIVE THE PLAYER MORE CHOICE!!! This is the big one. Give the player more freedom. I propose the following: instead of five events, make it ten events, and at each event, give the player a choice. They can fight to pick one of three cards (but risk elimination), upgrade one of their cards to make the effect more powerful, or replace an existing card with a random new card. The tenth event is forced to be a fight. The goal of this system is to give the player more choices over a longer period of time and give them more freedom as well as add a sort of risk-reward dynamic where the player can choose a fight, which risks elimination, but also gives a greater reward. This makes the roguelite mechanic of the game more fun---it gives the player more freedom, rewards good decision making, and adds a component of risk and reward.

Any feedback on this post is greatly appreciated. It's my first time posting in this sub and I'd like to see what everyone thinks of this.

TL;DR RNG based card packs bad, PVP is fundamentally flawed, players aren't given enough freedom in choices.

1ojh2ur,Making Lawrie playable - 3 different ways,"In current state, Lawrie is technically a pet, which doesn't really make sense.

I'm aware that making Lawrie playable is not really a big priority for the devs, however...

I present to you 3 ways in which Larry and Lawrie could be reworked. Each way rework the brawler from different angle and each way has its pros and cons.



**I - complete rework**

There are a lot of ideas of a complete rework for the twins and there are a lot of good ideas out there. However I'll describe only one of them ('m also pretty sure somebody already came up with similar idea):

In the beginning both twins spawn, but Larry is controlled by the player. If both twins are present, using super will switch the control between twins. When only one twin is present, super will now spawn the other twin (just like now). When player-controlled twin is defeated, control is switched to the twin that is alive.

The current gadgets, star-powers and hypercharge would probably also have to be reworked to match the new mechanics.

*Pros:*

\- the rework will make the twins much more interesting and unique. In the current state, twins are extremly similar to Juju when it comes to basic mechanics (they're both spawner throwers)

*Cons:*

\- the rework would be time-consuming,

\- Larry and Lawrie would probably had their rarity changed (most likely to Legendary or Ultra Legendary), which would increase the cost of unlocking them dramatically.



**II - reworking ""Swap"" gadget**

At the current state, ""Swap"" gadget only swaps the weapons, but I feel like this could be brought step further and actually make that player actually switches control to the other twin.

This is also one of the most popular ideas, brought up by community.

*Pros:*

\- probably the most simple change, because I feel like current ""Swap"" gadget is like already halfway there. I think gadget cooldown wouldn't even need to be changed,

\- would make the ""Swap"" gadget more appealing and make choice between two gadgets slightly more difficult (currently, the ""Swap"" gadget is much worse than the second gadget),

\- the rarity of twins wouldn't need to be changed, because gadgets usually don't reflect the complexity and rarity of the brawler.

*Cons:*

\- in order to have playable Lawrie, you cannot use the second gadget,

\- not really compatible with star powers.



**III - adding the mythic gear**

Mythic gear: if Larry is defeated but Lawrie is on the map, player switches control to Lawrie. If Larry reappear  on the map, player's control instantly switches back to Larry.

*Pros:*

\- nothing needs to be changed in the twins current mechanics,

\- twins don't have a mythic gear yet, so the would get one.

*Cons:*

\- for the playable Lawrie, you would need to sacrifice one gear slot,

\- would kinda defeat the purpose of the ""Swap"" gadget.

1ombnb1,This Guy Doesn't Care About the Safety of the Brawl Community (Read Description),"So, the Starfield Offline Festival in Korea had a promotion yesterday (I had to repost because this was never checked) where attendees could get a bunch of Brawl Stars merch (really cute btw, please make a global shop) and other things. As a reward for attending the event, they had QR codes for Street Shade, Mecha Finx, Persephone Lumi, and Mecha Mortis (about 1500 uses each). Well, someone (I won't mention who just so that no further harassment meets them in case people are awful) decided to be kind enough to share the link with some in this person's Discord server. For the first skin it was fine, but then this guy caught wind of it and alerted everyone on his Twitter...

Commence the rush of hundreds and thousands of new members (who are clearly immature and probably not even old enough to be on Discord or Twitter) demanding for the link, saying slurs in chat, and many other awful things. The time comes and they post the next link. Link meets its limit.

I left the server after being overwhelmed by the wave of newbies. It was only moments later I found out the person received death threats and had to private their Twitter. This page did not address any of that and decided to post this tweet right after. After discussing with some members in the KTK Discord about the incident, I come to find out that DEATH THREATS are not an INSTA BAN, but a STRIKE. Additionally, this page does not care about keeping a safe community, and they rather would hit 45k members than ensure the safety of others. There were barely any mods, and they were ill equipped with the tools to moderate properly.

3: XP doublers for quests, do i even need to explain? Everyone wanted this!


HM: the new trio game modes. Although i dont think gem grab will work super well, i have more faith in trio wipeout, which i think will be in my top game modes OAT.

2: the new random 6 wins = 6 rewards (that can differ)! Its something i enjoy from this event, so seeing it stay with some different things, INCLUDING different boxes, is something i like, and honestly, you cant complain about rewards! I am also wondering what the mech box is


HM 2: Mega quests. Really worth it IMO. Good rewards, for some quests you can grind through. I enjoy this!

1: my favorite thing is the upside down showdown! i personally like all the power ups (for example mutations and angel powers), but the only thing that i didnt like was that it sometimes forced you to play other game modes when you didnt feel like playing with the powers.

Upside down showdown works because normal showdown still exists, and the powers work best in showdown.

1ku2dzv,New Exotic and Common Rarity Brawl Stars June Update (Concept),"I decided to make two new rarities to deal with the fact that we have nearly 100 brawlers, and that majority of the brawlers are in epic and mythic, making it feel clustered. I have added two new rarity's to help spread them out, and to also diversify each rarity.

Common Rarity:

The common rarity are for the easy to play brawlers and they will be distributed amongst the trophy road. This will make the starr road feel less cluttered and give new players a reason to want to farm trophies, rather than credits.

Exotic Rarity:

It could be in-between Epic and Mythic. These brawlers are very unique and offer unique effects in the game. EG: Silence, hypnotise, slow attacks, pull, go through walls. Could be on the starr road for 1300 credits as a cheaper alternative to mythics but a better alternative then epics.

I have also adjusted and relocated brawlers down a tier to make them more accessible and to acknowledge that half of these easy to play brawlers, EG: Doug, Jae Yong, Edgar, Ruffs should not be that high in rarity. Rarities should reflect how easy or hard a brawler is to play based on their tier, and the overall skill experssion.

1olwe5z,Matchmaking should account for brawler level to an extent,"The gap in power between a level 7/8 brawler and a level 11 one is too wide.

All of my non-maxed-out brawlers are at a minimum level 7 (or 8 if they received an hypercharge that can’t be used yet). They also all have 500+ trophies.

But doing any of the character based quests is too time consuming as you effectively have to camp and hope a level 11 doesn’t come by where you can’t meaningfully fight back or make an escape.

I know they reworked everything with a sort of sliding scale between individual brawler trophies and overall account trophies. But I feel like there should be some kind of cap (max 2 levels up or down from your brawler’s level).

I’m sure it’s by design to encourage people to spend on upgrading brawlers, but it takes a lot of the fun out of it.

Here are 2 possible reasons why our predictions didn't work:

1st is:
We are VERY unlucky

2nd is:
THEY ARE TROLLING US!

it possible that they're lying to us about the 
""Possible rewards"" and the ""we have pre-recorded vids so you know that we aren't rigging it"" bullcrap

It is obvious that they are watching our videos,
Our predictions, and is giving us small tidbits and hints on what door has the ones we want,
Only for them to make a video showing us that we are ""wrong"".

I think they are doing this to keep us grinding for quests to keep us playing, to keep us paying,
So that they will earn more revenue from F2P's & P2W's to either earn more money or earn back what they lost last update

OR THEY ARE JUST GENUINELY TROLLING US

1ol5qkw,Kit Rework,"WHY DO WE NEED THIS REWORK?

This rework is aimed at making Kit a Support/ Assassin because right now he's an Assassin/ Support.

Kit right now has too many assassin trait and not enough support traits: high movement speed, passive super charge, high burst damage (mostly in solo cuz of 1st SP), jump, invisibility even his HC is based on his assassin side, when his only support trait is his healing.

My first thought was to reduce damage and increase healing. That part was easy, lower basic damage from 2000 to 1200 that way he cant just burst you down with basic then jump and finish you off, i removed the damage for the super for that same reason. Then i added a heal of 2000 on landing on your ally to promote playing as a support. Kit continues to heal per second and damage per second when attached to an ally/enemy. And his stun stays.

Then came the harder balances, since kit is close range and deals so little damage i raised his HP from 6000 to 8200, and since he wont be bursting down enemies and will have to play more as a support, he gets the support trait (super charge when near allies).

Kit will also receive a 5% movement speed buff from 820 to 864 (as fast a Draco in dragon form).

Then comes this atrocious Gadget: Cardboard Box. Don’t worry i also reworked it. Cardboard Box becomes Purrfect Manicure: Kit gains 1000 damage to his basic attack and super for 4s, cooldown: 27s. This way he can become an assassin for a short time

There’s also his ridiculous SP: Power Hungry. And guys, I GOT YOU! Power Hungry becomes Kitty Soft Paws: Every 5s Kit’s next basic heals allies for 1200

His HC doesn’t get reworked but it gets an added effect for jumping on an ally: The ally Kit is attached to gets hypercharged for the duration of Kit’s HC

With these changes kit will have more of the Support traits: charge super near allies, instant healing, more healing, stun, and HC, while still having some assassin traits: fast movement speed, jump, and half of his HC.

HOW WILL KIT BE PLAYED?

Kit will be played as a “companion”, he can stick close to an assassin or tank, and stun enemies for his allies, or jump to them for some well needed healing. While his new Gadget can give him 1v1 capabilities to survive ambushes. He will be countered by control brawlers such as Jessy, Belle, Penny, while still being strong against marksmen with his stun and Gadget.

AFTERWORD.

There’s still work to be done with this Rework, such as the 2nd SP since he now has 2 defensive SPs, as well as some extra balancing cause I made up all these numbers myself and i have 0 experience with balancing.

Thank you for reading and for your upcoming feedback.

TLDR: Kit is now a Support Brawler with less overall damage and more healing, while getting a Gadget to retain some of his assassin capabilities.

1ko3o2r,Gem grab is a poorly aged game mode,"I say poorly aged is due to how non-existent the overtime balance for the mode is compared to other gamemodes. Gem Hogging is so easy in this mode with brawlers that have either movement options,dps, or both that makes this mode unenjoyable. Especially if the winning team is at the spawn and the loosing team just respawned, basically making it impossible to have a comeback unless due to very lucky factors. I believe a easy solution is to make the maps smaller so that going back into the brawl isn't such a chore.

1kkau3n,"This event is probably the worst we've had, for multiple reasons","* **The sushis themselves have terrible drop rates and rewards in terms of progression.** Sure you can get hypercharges and starr powers but for 0.15% drop chance, is this a joke? You can't even get mythic or legendary brawlers. And let's be honest what am I gonna do with the 20 bling / 10 pp / 25 coins i get per sushi? - basically rare starr drops. Supercell made a clever move by adding many wasabi powers with high drop rate to cover up so we wouldn't spot the bad progression. Don't even get me started on the sushi split chances. 
* **The club event is insanely scummy.** There is no reason for the victories needed to collect sushi to INCREASE for every time you collect one. HEAVILY slowing down progression as the event progresses. And we get 4 tickets per day, which requires us to constantly play a quite large amount in total as segments, which feels like a chore. 
* **Sushi meter is unrewarding**: 1000 credits and 25 gems is all we get for collecting sushi, which is especially bad because it goes to fame. If you are f2p and don't sweat your ass off you are prob not getting the hypercharge skin.
* **My hot take about wasabi powers**: I don't like wasabi powers because they limit me so I can only play 3 modes and these modes/maps don't always work for the brawlers I want to play, leaving me with oftenly only playing ranked. In wasabi-gamemodes you can only used the meta wasabis, or you're getting shit on. And i've unlocked some of them but it is on my underleveled brawlers. And it pains me in the ass when my teammates pick non-wasabi brawlers in wasabi gamemode.
* **The skins and aesthetic is basically the only good thing imo**: but god knows how long it's going to take for me to unlock the skins I want, or infact if I am able to be lucky enough to get them at all. Samurai smash is so unbalanced and based on RNG. The turnaround potential is also too big. You can lose even when you hold control.

1ogklwa,Brawl pass idea,"So we have multiple type of people right? 

The ""I dont have enough coins"" mostly mid/end game player

The ""i dont gave enough power points"" player, yes they exist hi im one of them 

And the ""damn man kaze take so much time to unlock 💀💀"" 

So i got a silly idea which come from from a mixt of genshin impact battle pass ressource AND the actual brawler choice 

As of right now we get soke coins, some power point and some credits....but how about we can CHOOSE? 

So you can see up here a montage ive done to show how it would work so we would still have every 2/3 tier a star drop but at some point maybe goint starrdrop/choice/starrdrop/choice/gems FOR EXAMPLE 

And the choice would be beetween the 3 main resources so either 1000 coins, 1000 power points or 200 credits 

Of course its an idea i just got so theyre probably heavy hole into that concept let me know and thank you very much for reading everything :>

1olk3zw,Why door no.17 WILL contain the Manga Kenji skin #scarydoors #brawlstars,"Let me explain:
You can see that the vending machine door has 12 buttons, and Kenji is the 12th legendary brawler released in the game. Not only that but this vending machine hints that it was Rico's ex girlfriend, and Rico is the 5th released super rare brawler, so if you subtract 5 to 17, which is the door number (17 - 5), it equals to 12, which relates again to Kenji coincidentally being the 12th released legendary brawler. 

But you can also see a heart in the vending machine, if you count the contents of the vending machine until the heart, it'll be 4, which is also the number of stubble hair in Kenji's face, but that's not all the Heart signifies love, and Kenji loves Kaze, Kaze was released in May of 2025, and Kenji was released in September 2024, if you look closely of you subtracted the 9th month to the 5th month (9 - 5) it equals to 4, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED AT, but we can go deeper. The gap between Kenji and Kaze is 9 months apart, it meaning the amount of Kenji skin (Default Kenji, Fruit Samurai Kenji, Hebi Kenji, Mamushi Kenji, Aodaisho Kenji, Cursed Kenji, Oni Kenji, Kizu Kenji, and the 9th one being the MANGA KENJI).

But we can go even deeper. With the appearance of the vending machine, you can see the hole of the cracked glass slightly silhouetting the hypercharge form of Oni Kenji, specifically the bushy hair of its form, but that's not only the hint, the dispenser hole has an arrow symbol on it, and it seems it's 2 arrows on it, the 2 meaning the two swords Kenji is holding in his hypercharge form.

But we can go even deeper, the color of the purple vending machine is the hex code #8d4db8, which splits into three two-character hex bytes.
8d in hex: 8 * 16 + d(=13) = 128 + 13 = 141.
4d in hex: 4 * 16 + d(=13) = 64 + 13 = 77.
b8 in hex: b(=11) * 16 + 8 = 176 + 8 = 184.
So in RGB it'll be 141, 77, 184. Now look closely, because if you multiply the red by the green (141 * 77), you get 10,857. Now, what happens when you divide that by the blue (10,857 ÷ 184)? You get 59.02, which is eerily close to 60,and  if you subtract that 60 from the red channel (141 - 60), you land on 81, and if you take that 8+1, you get 9, which is September, the very month Kenji was released. Coincidence? Hell no.
Now take the blue channel and divide it by the green channel(141 ÷ 77) and you get 2.389, and when you add the digits together (2+3+8+9), you get 22, which, if you look at the calendar grid of September 2024,  is just FOUR, FOUR days before Kenji’s actual release date, September 26, symbolizing the heart in the vending machine.
And when you take every number in the hex (8, 13, 4, 13, 11, and 8, because “d”=13 and “b”=11), and just sum them straight, you get 58. Now (5+8 = 13), and (1+3 = 4), Which again, symbolizing the placement of the heart in the vending machine.

But even with all this in mind, I actually felt THAT THIS IS the door leading to Manga Kenji. Since during the time Oct 31, 2025, exactly in 1:36 AM whilst I was asleep, I felt my armpit hair follicles get goosebumps, why did that happen you ask? Well, that might actually signaled me to 17, why? Well If you align the digits of October 31, 2025, 01:36 AM like coordinates (10 | 31 | 25 | 01 | 36), and sum them straight (10 + 31 + 25 + 1 + 36), you get the number 103. Subtract the number of letters in “Friday” (6) and “October” (7), and what do you get? (103 - 13), equalling to 90. Divide that by the number of minutes past 1 AM (90 ÷ 36), and you get 2.5. 2.5 meaning (2 + 5) = 7, now add back the 1 of 1 AM, AND YOU GET 17, WHICH IS THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE DOOR THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR.

1ok574e,"Current starr road is flawed, here how to fix it.","So as of now and since 2022 the STARR ROAD is something that is yes is still better than pure gambling, but still flawed, what do i mean by that, pretty simple. It goes the way the devs want you to go. Its always you start with shelly get nita then bull colt rosa poco the super rare then you have to choose beetween bo and emz. Everyone have the same starr road and i find that honestly boring especially when you look at how the chromatic brawler were handled with the chroma credits.....wait but THATS IT 

Let me introduce you to the STARR PATH 

What is the Starr Path you might ask? Pretty simple little Tomar 

The Starr Path is your path to be, well....a raising starr and for that youll need brawler for that but why taking the same path as all the other you are you and they are they.

Enough foreplay, the Starr Path would be a way to unlock brawler the way we want to do, because as of now as i stated its the same path for everyone and lets say you want juju but are a f2p, you have to luck or to wait many many MANYYYY well even too many brawler and when you look at how the end of the road is looking all red mythic mythic mythic its just tasteless. The starrpath could work like the chromatic brawler were handle, an old brawler like leon would take lets say 3 mythic and 5 epic on your account to be able to choose him, spike, or crow 

As for a more recent uni legendary such as Kenji (he is in door 6, colette told me), youd need 6 mythic and 10 epics to or lets say 5 mythic and 7 epics and preferably a legendary or 2 before. It would let people, casual, new or returning player to have theyre own choice have theyre own....path

From my experience his damage output is way to high for a support. At level 11 when I hit both projectiles it is 2800 dmg and 8400 if all ammo and all projectiles are being hit, which is enough to bring down a lot of brawlers.

I think Ruffs has potential to be a great support. I'd like to see the hp increase of his support SP being buffed to distinguish him as a support.

1olnrnl,Quitting after 4 years,"I have been playing brawl stars since 2021. I really enjoy it but I have decided to quit due to various frustrations I have with the game, and it just keeps getting worse. I don't care about events, boxes, star drops or any other cosmetics or monetary changes. The core gameplay was enough to keep me in. 

I was never particularly a strong player but I have reached a point where I lose 5 games before winning one no matter which mode I play. I reached mythic every season in ranked previously but I wasn't able to pass diamond for the last 2 seasons. 4 years and I don't have a single 1000 trophy brawler. Now you might think I'm leaving because I am just bad at playing. That is not the case. I am a star player 4 out of 5 matches I lose. In ranked, it's just bad teammates straight up picking not so good brawlers. In ladder, there is so much griefing now. Before writing this tweet, I lost 4 matches in a row because one teammate just went offline in all the matches. To make the matters worse, I kept getting matched with him repeatedly, and this is not the first time this has happened. I really wish there was a report button in ladder as there is in ranked. You might say play showdown but we all know what's up with it.

Now this frustration is probably I just don't have any friends who play brawl. I am forced to play with randoms and it just isn't working out. I have decided to quit as of now, maybe I'll come back, maybe not. 

I probably just suck but I tried.

1olwe5z,Matchmaking should account for brawler level to an extent,"The gap in power between a level 7/8 brawler and a level 11 one is too wide.

All of my non-maxed-out brawlers are at a minimum level 7 (or 8 if they received an hypercharge that can’t be used yet). They also all have 500+ trophies.

But doing any of the character based quests is too time consuming as you effectively have to camp and hope a level 11 doesn’t come by where you can’t meaningfully fight back or make an escape.

I know they reworked everything with a sort of sliding scale between individual brawler trophies and overall account trophies. But I feel like there should be some kind of cap (max 2 levels up or down from your brawler’s level).

I’m sure it’s by design to encourage people to spend on upgrading brawlers, but it takes a lot of the fun out of it.

1ombnb1,This Guy Doesn't Care About the Safety of the Brawl Community (Read Description),"So, the Starfield Offline Festival in Korea had a promotion yesterday (I had to repost because this was never checked) where attendees could get a bunch of Brawl Stars merch (really cute btw, please make a global shop) and other things. As a reward for attending the event, they had QR codes for Street Shade, Mecha Finx, Persephone Lumi, and Mecha Mortis (about 1500 uses each). Well, someone (I won't mention who just so that no further harassment meets them in case people are awful) decided to be kind enough to share the link with some in this person's Discord server. For the first skin it was fine, but then this guy caught wind of it and alerted everyone on his Twitter...

Commence the rush of hundreds and thousands of new members (who are clearly immature and probably not even old enough to be on Discord or Twitter) demanding for the link, saying slurs in chat, and many other awful things. The time comes and they post the next link. Link meets its limit.

I left the server after being overwhelmed by the wave of newbies. It was only moments later I found out the person received death threats and had to private their Twitter. This page did not address any of that and decided to post this tweet right after. After discussing with some members in the KTK Discord about the incident, I come to find out that DEATH THREATS are not an INSTA BAN, but a STRIKE. Additionally, this page does not care about keeping a safe community, and they rather would hit 45k members than ensure the safety of others. There were barely any mods, and they were ill equipped with the tools to moderate properly. The Brawl team needs to address QR codes in the future to prevent this level of entitlement from happening, or I fear many others will fall into this cycle.",https://i.redd.it/t51wql1avsyf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ombnb1/this_guy_doesnt_care_about_the_safety_of_the/,95,1762070303.0,image,media\images\1ombnb1.jpeg,Feedback/Rant,Anger,"The user is expressing strong anger and frustration regarding the mismanagement of a promotional event, specifically the distribution of QR codes for skins.

1kholce,Advice needed: what's missing to my box for ranked? (Currently Mythic 2),"Hello guys, since the ranked rework I couldn't go over M3 (I'm at 30k+ trophees on my account so I consider to be pretty early game).

What in your opinion are missing P11 i should upgrade to move forward in ranked ?

The three first raws + Colette and Ash are P11.

I'm hesitating at the moment between :
- Gray
- Hank (I have the HC)
- Rico
- angelo or eve to have a water walking option 
- bo 
- Griff
- Long range like Mandy or Belle (got Belle's HC)

Thank you for your advice!

1oharzz,Ducktales event idea,"**Why?**

With a lot of 80's stuff getting referenced in the new update (not just because of the current IP, but also the gym skins having the same 80's vibe), I think it's possible that with Christmas we're getting a Ducktales event, due to Scrooge McDuck being based on Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous A Christmas Carol. Though this theory and my ""evidence"" for it is centered around the 1987 show, I think the event would primarily be based around the 2017 reboot.

Edit: turns out a Mecha season is for December. It could still be for January while the Scrooge skin is given out during Christmas.

**Skins**

* Mico as Scrooge McDuck. Free Epic skin. Mico was free during the Christmas event in 2023 and this is a good way to reference the well-known pogo-jumping mechanic from the NES Ducktales game.
* Cordelius as Donald Duck. Mythic skin. They both wear a hat and have a cape-like thing. If Donald's hat gets very exaggerated, it can fit into Cordelius' silhouette. They're also a bit difficult to understand voice-wise.
* Doug as Huey. Brawl Pass skin, Dewey and Louie reskins. Gus has recently gotten a skin so using Gus once again for a collab skin can come off as ""industry-planting"". Maybe it can be Lena carrying the corresponding triplet on her shoulders, as I can't think of any other way of representing her without increasing the number of skins to an unrealistic amount. The hotdog is replaced by a Pep soda can.
* Nani and Peep as Webby and Launchpad. Epic skin. Nani already has a duck-like skin (Sally Nani) and this is a pretty decent way to reference the running gag of Launchpad not being the best pilot while still being very reliable.
* Pam as Miss Beakley. Super Rare skin. They're both big women and this skin can be considered profitable, especially if Pam gets her promised rework during this collab.
* (Optional) Griff as Flintheart Glomgold. They're both greedy and I think Griff's personality and more chunky body fits better with Glomgold than Scrooge.
* Lola as Magica de Spell. Hypercharge, Vesuvian (red) and Tulpafire (blue) recolors. They're both egotistical, maniacal, and the Ego can be a stand-in for Magica's shadow, though her shadow behaving on its own is more of a Lorcana thing. The Hypercharge form can reference the wyvern transformation seen in the Nightmare on Killmotor Hill episode. Also black and purple are very prominent on Magica's color scheme, and we all know that the younger side of the playerbase loves skins that contain black and purple as prominent colors.

**Gamemodes:**

* Bot hunt. It's like Robo Rumble, but there's no Heist Safe so it's purely about survival. The bots are also much stronger and you need to collect the bolts they drop to confirm the bots as taken down.
* Ultimate Showdown. Showdown but with 12 players. To accommodate for having to deal with more opponents and make Brawler viability within this gamemode more consistent, Power Cubes and Ruffs' Power-Up boost HP by a percentage of the maximum HP with a minimum of the default HP boost.
* 5v5 Brawl Arena. It's like Brawl Arena, but 5v5. Towers and Base have double HP, deal 35% more damage and have shields.
* Boss Fight. Possible bosses consist of: Oni Kenji, Spirit Knight Frank, Scorpion Chuck, Kraken Surge and Magica Lola. Magica Lola also has a ""Hyper Boss"" Hyper Magica Lola variant with doubled Normal difficulty HP (HP increase per difficulty is still only 30k) and attacks that unload faster so she can cycle her attacks more often, but Hypercharges of all Brawlers are pernamently active, Gadgets recharge twice as fast, Brawlers passively recover HP twice as fast and Energy Drinks can spawn.

**Shop**

With a new currency you get from Daily Wins, Daily Reward Chain, Quests and Boss Fights, you're able to buy Treasure Boxes and guaranteed skins from Funzo's Fun Zone. After spending a certain high amount of this temporary currency, you'll obtain Magica Lola for free. Treasure Boxes can contain cosmetics from Once Upon (some of the more evil skins from that theme to be specific), Dark Sands, Sands of Time (Shelly Dancer, Dynasty Mike and Dark Samurai Gene excluded), Cursed Pirates, Gym Rats, Brawlidays, Dark Brawlidays and Ducktales. Treasure Boxes are also the only real way to get Lola Magica's recolors, as they would be in the loot pool and unlocking the main version early from Treasure Boxes allows one of the recolors to be unlocked guaranteed instead.

**Lore**

Not really necessary but I do want to have a little story going on. After the events of the Brawl-O-Ween event, an incident with a restored >!Ramrod!<(I don't want to ruin surprises for people who watch Ducktales 2017) causes the Ducktales characters to be fused with their Brawler counterparts, bringing the Ducktales skins to life. To wreak havoc on Starr Park and in an attempt to get Scrooge's Dime, the now Kaiju-sized Magica Lola summons Spirit Knight Frank and reincarnates Kizu Kenji back to Oni Kenji. She gets assisted by Scorpion Chuck and Kraken Surge, both of which have also become Kaiju-sized for an unknown reason.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,3,1761560787.0,text_only,,Art/Concept,Neutral/Other,"The user is proposing a highly detailed and comprehensive 'Ducktales event idea' for Brawl Stars.

1on8en7,This event really shows why the community sucks sometimes,"I’m glad we finally got the skin, it’s nice considering i didn’t have oni or kizu Kenji, wouldn’t have minded if not but I’ll take it. Many people like Kenji and would be in the same position as me, so it’s natural that they want the skin. Obviously it is annoying that we got some mid and bad rewards because of the guesses people were making but you know those guesses made logical sense, and we still ended up getting some of the best rewards like a hyper drop. People are glazing things like the ultra trophy box, which definitely might get you a cool skin, but is unlikely to give any significant progression, and could end up being a bad skin for a brawler you don’t play. I really don’t like people are getting so mad at community members and content creators like BrawlReflex for making guesses, these people act so arrogant when the guesses are wrong acting like “it was obvious”, when i highly doubt that they could have made any better guesses, because they are guesses, the boxes are meant to trick you so it’s about trying, you cannot fully predict what a door would have, so stop acting like you’re better than others, and getting mad at others for doing what you’re supposed to do in the event.

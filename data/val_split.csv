1nv6ldv,New monthly flairs! Please read before suggesting.,"Hello again, it’s been a minute since the last drop of flairs. (We did the first 2 drops back to back so we could start releasing on the first of every month.)

FLAIRS

Special thanks to u/Qubelek for the iconic Tomar753 suggestion, and to u/Aggressive-War-3260 for the sarcastic King of Hot Zone suggestion. We do value your opinions and would like to hear suggestions.

That being said, there are some things we should say first before you suggest anything. Firstly, please try to suggest a brawler without a special flair yet (spread the love). As great as it would be to have multiple ironic Edgar flairs, it would be awesome to have some flairs for the less loved brawlers such as Otis. 

Once the release date for Ziggy is confirmed we will release his flair. (Don’t worry, we didn’t forget)

OTHER THINGS

We are always on the lookout for great moderator candidates. You can never have too many, especially in a big sub like this 😉.

1ok574e,"Current starr road is flawed, here how to fix it.","So as of now and since 2022 the STARR ROAD is something that is yes is still better than pure gambling, but still flawed, what do i mean by that, pretty simple. It goes the way the devs want you to go. Its always you start with shelly get nita then bull colt rosa poco the super rare then you have to choose beetween bo and emz. Everyone have the same starr road and i find that honestly boring especially when you look at how the chromatic brawler were handled with the chroma credits.....wait but THATS IT 

Let me introduce you to the STARR PATH 

What is the Starr Path you might ask? Pretty simple little Tomar 

The Starr Path is your path to be, well....a raising starr and for that youll need brawler for that but why taking the same path as all the other you are you and they are they.

Enough foreplay, the Starr Path would be a way to unlock brawler the way we want to do, because as of now as i stated its the same path for everyone and lets say you want juju but are a f2p, you have to luck or to wait many many MANYYYY well even too many brawler and when you look at how the end of the road is looking all red mythic mythic mythic its just tasteless. The starrpath could work like the chromatic brawler were handle, an old brawler like leon would take lets say 3 mythic and 5 epic on your account to be able to choose him, spike, or crow 

As for a more recent uni legendary such as Kenji (he is in door 6, colette told me), youd need 6 mythic and 10 epics to or lets say 5 mythic and 7 epics and preferably a legendary or 2 before. It would let people, casual, new or returning player to have theyre own choice have theyre own....path 

And it also help the youtubers so they can make video such as ""top 10 brawler to prioritize on the starr path season 56""

1ojw2rn,Theory: Manga Kenji could be behind the 1 Gem Door,"Evidence explanation:

Oni Kenji is a Hypercharge skin related to purple flame energy, Hypercharge, and green flame energy, Wasabi Power. Either by coincidence or on purpose, these are also the colors of the Gem Grab Gems and Paid Gems respectively. 

Purple Gems are known to be related to superpowers within Starr Park lore and can cause aggression. Wasabi Powers in the manga can turn the entities who eat the powered Wasabi it into Yokai, implying these contain green Gem powder considering the stuff purple Gems can do within Starr Park lore. It seems to me that the different-colored Gems provide different mutations, with purple Gems Hypercharging people while green Gems turn people into different versions of themselves, which could even be skins. And guess what high-rarity skins can only be bought with, including Hypercharge skins on certain occasions? Green Gems. Within the Manga, Oni Kenji’s flame-tattoo is actually Cursed Kenji’s green amulet that can break, which could be made out of green Gems.

In a previous community event related to completing Quests, Knight Doug was able to be obtained practically for free. By “purchasing” a chain of offers by using the 1 free Gem, Knight Doug could be obtained with 1 Gold.

My theory is that none of the doors truly contain Manga Kenji. Instead, we have to “free” him by opening up the door that gives us only 1 Gem and then by purchasing a chain of offers with this 1 Gem we can claim him basically for free, basically repeating what they did with Knight Doug.",https://i.redd.it/9f1q11z588yf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ojw2rn/theory_manga_kenji_could_be_behind_the_1_gem_door/,40,1761820256.0,image,media\images\1ojw2rn.jpeg,Discussion,Neutral/Other,"The user is presenting a detailed theory about how a specific in-game element (Manga Kenji) might be obtained, drawing connections between various lore elements, past events, and game mechanics.

1okoybu,Title: Shop improvement suggestion,"Subject: Suggestion to simplify and reorganize the in-game shop
Hey! I wanted to share a small but important suggestion about the in-game shop.

Right now, the shop feels overloaded with too many repeating or unnecessary sections. For example, the Battle Pass and Pro Pass purchase tabs don’t really need to be there — they already exist in the Battle Pass screen and in the Ranked section. It just makes the shop look messy and harder to navigate.

Also, the amount of separate skin offers is overwhelming. It would be much cleaner if skins appeared only in their respective brawler or collection catalogs — with small discount tags or event markers when needed — instead of taking up extra space in the main shop.

Overall, the shop would look much more organized, and players could find what they want faster. I think many players would really appreciate this change.

1ohcvy4,Ruffs is currently not a support,"So basically the title. I gave Ruffs a go and carried most of the games I played. I am not gonna pretend I am pro, or even play at that level. This is solely based on my trip from 560 -> 700 trophies.

From my experience his damage output is way to high for a support. At level 11 when I hit both projectiles it is 2800 dmg and 8400 if all ammo and all projectiles are being hit, which is enough to bring down a lot of brawlers.

I think Ruffs has potential to be a great support. I'd like to see the hp increase of his support SP being buffed to distinguish him as a support.
And i'd even like to do something about his super being way too rewarding used offensively rather than being rewarding to aim to buff yourself or your teammates.

What do you think?

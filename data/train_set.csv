1ojw2rn,Theory: Manga Kenji could be behind the 1 Gem Door,"Evidence explanation:

Oni Kenji is a Hypercharge skin related to purple flame energy, Hypercharge, and green flame energy, Wasabi Power. Either by coincidence or on purpose, these are also the colors of the Gem Grab Gems and Paid Gems respectively. 

Purple Gems are known to be related to superpowers within Starr Park lore and can cause aggression. Wasabi Powers in the manga can turn the entities who eat the powered Wasabi it into Yokai, implying these contain green Gem powder considering the stuff purple Gems can do within Starr Park lore. It seems to me that the different-colored Gems provide different mutations, with purple Gems Hypercharging people while green Gems turn people into different versions of themselves, which could even be skins. And guess what high-rarity skins can only be bought with, including Hypercharge skins on certain occasions? Green Gems. Within the Manga, Oni Kenji’s flame-tattoo is actually Cursed Kenji’s green amulet that can break, which could be made out of green Gems.

In a previous community event related to completing Quests, Knight Doug was able to be obtained practically for free. By “purchasing” a chain of offers by using the 1 free Gem, Knight Doug could be obtained with 1 Gold.

My theory is that none of the doors truly contain Manga Kenji. Instead, we have to “free” him by opening up the door that gives us only 1 Gem and then by purchasing a chain of offers with this 1 Gem we can claim him basically for free, basically repeating what they did with Knight Doug.",https://i.redd.it/9f1q11z588yf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ojw2rn/theory_manga_kenji_could_be_behind_the_1_gem_door/,40,1761820256.0,image,media\images\1ojw2rn.jpeg,Discussion,Neutral/Other,"The user is presenting a detailed theory about how a specific in-game element (Manga Kenji) might be obtained, drawing connections between various lore elements, past events, and game mechanics.

1og0f2t,Isn’t the new update kinda…. Bad?,"I’m playing brawl stars since 2018 and I couldn’t notice the constant downgrade that Supercell were doing to the game. 

The new skins are very MID (mechas as well), they haven’t added a big change to the game as they promised (I mean c’mon, 6 dog water rewards instead of 3 isn’t that much of a deal). Also, the hypercharge change does completely nothing? I mean I use Kenji’s hyper not because I want some stats, but because I want a pull. The returning boxes thing is as bad, the whole event spirit is completely gone from them and idk how to bring it back. I mean seriously, mega and omega quests aren’t that exciting, because regular pass is more than enough to get all the rewards. Rogue like mode is also meh RNG based thing, like hypercharge events. 

The example of good game development is clash games. CR is not implementing anything new, but reworking old stuff so it feels fresh and modern. CoC on the other hand tries to maintain interest by buffing old systems and adding small stuff that changes the game (even the craft defenses are valuable)

And the new brawler… is just awful. ANOTHER MYTHIC ASSASIN!!!

1nv6ldv,New monthly flairs! Please read before suggesting.,"Hello again, it’s been a minute since the last drop of flairs. (We did the first 2 drops back to back so we could start releasing on the first of every month.)

FLAIRS

Special thanks to u/Qubelek for the iconic Tomar753 suggestion, and to u/Aggressive-War-3260 for the sarcastic King of Hot Zone suggestion. We do value your opinions and would like to hear suggestions.

That being said, there are some things we should say first before you suggest anything. Firstly, please try to suggest a brawler without a special flair yet (spread the love). As great as it would be to have multiple ironic Edgar flairs, it would be awesome to have some flairs for the less loved brawlers such as Otis. 

Once the release date for Ziggy is confirmed we will release his flair. (Don’t worry, we didn’t forget)

OTHER THINGS

We are always on the lookout for great moderator candidates. You can never have too many, especially in a big sub like this 😉.

How about I remind everyone something. Look at this in-game tip:

>Use Pins and sprays in-game to express ***your*** emotions.

Do you remember the true meaning of pins? Showing **YOUR OWN** emotions and how YOU feel about the situation.

Do we intentionally use happy pins when only someone else is happy? 

Obviously, we don't. We use them to show that **we** are happy, not others. Then why for the clown pin people think that it implies literally the opposite?

That also spreads to monkey pins. They reference the old phrase ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" (basically, don't think or do evil things). But these are literally used for evil, ""to show that enemy is a monkey"".

With this in mind, if you use clown pin, then **you** feel like a clown. If you use monkey pin, it would depend on the gesture (you don't wanna see/hear/speak).

1oharzz,Ducktales event idea,"**Why?**

With a lot of 80's stuff getting referenced in the new update (not just because of the current IP, but also the gym skins having the same 80's vibe), I think it's possible that with Christmas we're getting a Ducktales event, due to Scrooge McDuck being based on Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous A Christmas Carol. Though this theory and my ""evidence"" for it is centered around the 1987 show, I think the event would primarily be based around the 2017 reboot.

Edit: turns out a Mecha season is for December. It could still be for January while the Scrooge skin is given out during Christmas.

**Skins**

* Mico as Scrooge McDuck. Free Epic skin. Mico was free during the Christmas event in 2023 and this is a good way to reference the well-known pogo-jumping mechanic from the NES Ducktales game.
* Cordelius as Donald Duck. Mythic skin. They both wear a hat and have a cape-like thing. If Donald's hat gets very exaggerated, it can fit into Cordelius' silhouette. They're also a bit difficult to understand voice-wise.
* Doug as Huey. Brawl Pass skin, Dewey and Louie reskins. Gus has recently gotten a skin so using Gus once again for a collab skin can come off as ""industry-planting"". Maybe it can be Lena carrying the corresponding triplet on her shoulders, as I can't think of any other way of representing her without increasing the number of skins to an unrealistic amount. The hotdog is replaced by a Pep soda can.
* Nani and Peep as Webby and Launchpad. Epic skin. Nani already has a duck-like skin (Sally Nani) and this is a pretty decent way to reference the running gag of Launchpad not being the best pilot while still being very reliable.
* Pam as Miss Beakley. Super Rare skin. They're both big women and this skin can be considered profitable, especially if Pam gets her promised rework during this collab.
* (Optional) Griff as Flintheart Glomgold. They're both greedy and I think Griff's personality and more chunky body fits better with Glomgold than Scrooge.
* Lola as Magica de Spell. Hypercharge, Vesuvian (red) and Tulpafire (blue) recolors. They're both egotistical, maniacal, and the Ego can be a stand-in for Magica's shadow, though her shadow behaving on its own is more of a Lorcana thing. The Hypercharge form can reference the wyvern transformation seen in the Nightmare on Killmotor Hill episode. Also black and purple are very prominent on Magica's color scheme, and we all know that the younger side of the playerbase loves skins that contain black and purple as prominent colors.

**Gamemodes:**

* Bot hunt. It's like Robo Rumble, but there's no Heist Safe so it's purely about survival. The bots are also much stronger and you need to collect the bolts they drop to confirm the bots as taken down.
* Ultimate Showdown. Showdown but with 12 players. To accommodate for having to deal with more opponents and make Brawler viability within this gamemode more consistent, Power Cubes and Ruffs' Power-Up boost HP by a percentage of the maximum HP with a minimum of the default HP boost.
* 5v5 Brawl Arena. It's like Brawl Arena, but 5v5. Towers and Base have double HP, deal 35% more damage and have shields.
* Boss Fight. Possible bosses consist of: Oni Kenji, Spirit Knight Frank, Scorpion Chuck, Kraken Surge and Magica Lola. Magica Lola also has a ""Hyper Boss"" Hyper Magica Lola variant with doubled Normal difficulty HP (HP increase per difficulty is still only 30k) and attacks that unload faster so she can cycle her attacks more often, but Hypercharges of all Brawlers are pernamently active, Gadgets recharge twice as fast, Brawlers passively recover HP twice as fast and Energy Drinks can spawn.

**Shop**

With a new currency you get from Daily Wins, Daily Reward Chain, Quests and Boss Fights, you're able to buy Treasure Boxes and guaranteed skins from Funzo's Fun Zone. After spending a certain high amount of this temporary currency, you'll obtain Magica Lola for free. Treasure Boxes can contain cosmetics from Once Upon (some of the more evil skins from that theme to be specific), Dark Sands, Sands of Time (Shelly Dancer, Dynasty Mike and Dark Samurai Gene excluded), Cursed Pirates, Gym Rats, Brawlidays, Dark Brawlidays and Ducktales. Treasure Boxes are also the only real way to get Lola Magica's recolors, as they would be in the loot pool and unlocking the main version early from Treasure Boxes allows one of the recolors to be unlocked guaranteed instead.

**Lore**

Not really necessary but I do want to have a little story going on. After the events of the Brawl-O-Ween event, an incident with a restored >!Ramrod!<(I don't want to ruin surprises for people who watch Ducktales 2017) causes the Ducktales characters to be fused with their Brawler counterparts, bringing the Ducktales skins to life. To wreak havoc on Starr Park and in an attempt to get Scrooge's Dime, the now Kaiju-sized Magica Lola summons Spirit Knight Frank and reincarnates Kizu Kenji back to Oni Kenji. She gets assisted by Scorpion Chuck and Kraken Surge, both of which have also become Kaiju-sized for an unknown reason.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,3,1761560787.0,text_only,,Art/Concept,Neutral/Other,"The user is proposing a highly detailed and comprehensive 'Ducktales event idea' for Brawl Stars.

Brawl Stars is obviously a game for lords, and a large percentage of its fan base is children.

When you create your account, you have to input your age. There is obviously a large amount of people who lie about their age, but I really doubt the super young ones know how to do that. Have difficult would it be to split the servers in half, between the ages of +16 and U16 or something like that. I feel like that is a very small change that could have a huge impact on everyone’s overall enjoyment of the game.

 It would also help with balancing because it would be easier to see what actual pros and good players want and need and currently use u stead of the current majority of children.

1ofbyri,"In your opinion, can a simple brawlers like Jacky still demand the minimum skill?","I see a lot of people criticizing Jacky because of her gameplay style which basically boils down to walking straight and destroying everything like an out of control bullet train. I don't really mind it and I don't think she's toxic, since she's an off-meta brawler who's easy to deal with most of the time. But there's something about her in terms of her skill floor and skill ceiling. Since simpler brawlers tend to be easier to understand and have more rigid mechanics, they will require more basic skills related to the player rather than their own mechanics such as game sense, positioning and dodging, unlike more complex brawlers like kaze who has a whole synergy in relation to her modes and build (gadgets and star powers). Jacky goes against all of this as she only has a single viable build and both her main attacks and supers are quite simple and similar, and there's really no problem with that after all she's a super rare, she can't be difficult to understand since she is a brawler unlocked at the beginning of the game by beginner players. She's only viable on two types of map (closed and bushy) and her hypercharge doesn't do much besides make her better at what she already was: pushing and pressuring. But the fact that she is a simple push tank makes her a challenging brawler to balance, as she has no place at the top of the meta precisely because she is easy to play and making her too strong would make the meta toxic and therefore making her hateful. It's a similar case to shelly, who is the starting brawler and can't get too strong since her mechanics are too simple and would turn the meta upside down, since anyone can get used to her gameplay in no time and 100% of players have her unlocked. Homever, Jacky is a noob stomper, she is strong against beginners, but she also has her cons, since her good matchups are impossible to lose and her bad matchups are impossible to win (surge, rico, spike, frank, el primo, bull, etc). And like I said, she's a balanced brawler, and her stats are relatively ok (aside from the unnecessary health nerf, but we didn't talk about that).

So my question still is: can jacky still demand skill?",https://i.redd.it/ozdxuwsc25xf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ofbyri/in_your_opinion_can_a_simple_brawlers_like_jacky/,6,1761346559.0,image,media\images\1ofbyri.jpeg,Discussion,Neutral/Other,"The user engages in a long, analytical discussion about the Brawler Jacky, questioning her skill requirements and balance within the game.

1oivnhr,random brawler idea,"I wanted to create a brawler that's a thrower but also has a very aggressive play style, so here's my attempt. He might be somewhat overpowered so I apologize in advance but this is my best attempt:

Name: Nade

Brawler type: Artillery 

Description: 
Nade is a veteran. Or at least that's what he likes to think. Hundreds of applications to join the military, and not one has been accepted... 



Stats (power level 11):

Health: 5000

Movement speed: Normal

Main attack: Grenade Toss

Nade throws a grenade, dealing explosion damage upon contact with a surface. Grenades also have shrapnel,  dealing damage past the explosion range. Nade can also use the explosion of the grenades to propel himself very far, at the cost of 500 health. Nade can attack while airborne.

Explosion damage: 2500

Shrapnel damage: 200 x 4

Range: Long

Reload speed: Very Fast

Ammo count: 1

Explosion launch distance: 8 tiles 



Super: Supply Drop

Nade calls in a supply drop, falling from the sky and upon landing breaks open, dealing 2000 damage to nearby enemies and dropping three MRE rations. Upon contact, each MRE ration heals him and friendly brawlers for 33% of their max health. Many MRE rations can be out at once, as long as Nade can get multiple supers. 

Super range: Very long

Damage to charge super: 10000



Special gears: Extra shrapnel

Each grenade has 4 extra shards of shrapnel 



Gadgets:

Gadget #1: Smoke Grenade 

Nade's next attack throws a smoke grenade instead of a regular grenade, which deals no damage but covers a large area in smoke, which conceals him and his team from enemy brawlers for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 20 seconds.

Gadget #2: Artillery Arm

Nade's next attack has its range, damage, and explosion radius increased by 50%. It also propels him twice as far.

Cooldown: 17 seconds.



Star powers: 

Star power #1: Pocket Rations

Every 3 seconds, Nade consumes a ration from his pocket, healing 33% of his max health.

Star power #2: Explosive Vest

When Nade's health drops below 50%, his vest explodes, dealing 3000 damage to enemy brawlers and knocking them back. 

Hypercharge: 

Nade's super now drops 6 rations instead of only 3. Each ration heals 50% instead of 33%, and can overheal up to 6000. Each ration also boosts damage and speed by +10% for 10 seconds, which can stack with other rations.

Damage to charge hyper: 30000 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oivnhr/random_brawler_idea/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oivnhr/random_brawler_idea/,0,1761713302.0,text_only,,Art/Concept,Neutral/Other,"The user is presenting a detailed concept for a new Brawler, 'Nade', including its stats, abilities, and lore.

1og7y6i,Another little Kaze fanfic I made(sequel),"

Title: Kaze learns Chess II.

…..And after I challenged Kaze to another chess match, she accepted. 1 turned into 2, 2 turned into 10, and 10 turned into 30 chess matches. By the time we finished our chess matches, it was already 7 am! Kaze: “What the-it’s morning already?! What time is it?!” Me: “7 am. How are we not tired-“ Me and Kaze suddenly doze off to sleep, most likely due to the fact that we both stayed up all night playing chess. 

(Timeskip to a few hours later.)
, Kaze splashed a bucket of water on me, both waking me up…and getting my clothes wet…..Me: “Ah! Cold! Cold!” I then look at my wet clothes. “Hey! You ruined my clothes!” Kaze chuckles, and then shows me one of her kimonos. Kaze: “Don’t worry, you can wear one of my kimonos!” I get a tad bit flustered. Me: “B-but kimonos are for girls-“ I then realize that I ether have to wear one of her kimonos, or have to wear wet, cold clothes. Me: “…Nevermind…I accept.” I put on the kimono, and it was surprisingly cozy! Me: “Hm. It actually isn’t that bad wearing a kimono.” I then realize what I said, and I cover up my mouth. Kaze: “Awww…you look so cute in that Kimono!” I start blushing and getting flustered, and I try to change the topic. Me: “W-well, what do you want to do today?” A smile forms on Kaze’s face. Kaze: “Let’s meet at the park later today. Get prepared, you look disheveled. And bring your chessboard.”

  I then leave her house. and I go back to my house. When I get to my house, I fix my hair, and straighten the kimono she gave me, since I indeed looked disheveled. After I did all of that, I started making a little present for Kaze(a chess-themed crown) because I’m becoming increasingly moonstruck with her. After an hour, I finish the crown, and put it in a box with wrapping paper. 

(Timeskip to a few hours later, and I come to the park)

 When I get to the park, I see Kaze at one of the picnic tables, and I sit across from her. Kaze: “Still wearing that Kimono, are we? I knew you would love it!” I blush, and I show her a box. Me: “I brought a little surprise for you!” Kaze then opens the box, and sees the crown I made for her. Kaze: “T-this is beautiful! I love it!” I then looked at her in the eyes. Me: “I have something to confess…” Kaze: “What is it?” With a nervous look on my face, I prepare to confess to her. “I….love you.” Kaze pulls out a rose, and puts it in my hands. Kaze: “Well…I love you too!” Kaze then pulls me to her to my engage in a long, passionate kiss….

After a minute, we finally pull away from the kiss.
Me: “So, since we love eachother, do you want to be a couple?” Kaze instantly replies: “Sure! Let’s play a few more chess matches to celebrate our love!” 
 
 After 30 minutes of playing chess, I have an idea for both of us. Me: “I have the best idea ever for the both of us!” Kaze has a look of curiosity on her face. Kaze: “What is it?” Me: “How about we both enter a chess competition, it’s happening next week!” Kaze considers the idea, and says: “Sure! Why not? Let’s be champions!”

1of80t7,Im quiting this game.,"After one an half year, hitting 50k trophies, I decided to quit this game because it started to make no sense. This will be a long post.

  
First of al nothing makes sense in this game. Support brawlers can assasinate you from the bushes (Kit),  deal thousands of damage from other side of the map (Byron), tank absolutely all the hyperchages of damage dealers (poco). 

Tanks can ambush  easily from the bushes (Frank), assasinate just by walking towards you (Bibi), control the area with spamming basic attack (Meg).

Throwers are more or less balanced, if you dont question why a thrower has a marksmans range (Grom), a damage dealer's damage (L&L).

Marksmans, who are supposed to be deadly at range and weak at close combat can kill you when you get close also. Nani just blasts you with his super, Bea can two-shot you with her basic attacks etc etc. Plus, what is the purpose of assasins if almost all of the markmans have gadget to avoid them. Piper, Brock and other I cant care to count.  Not even mentioning area controllers like EMZ and Genie.

There are other things that doesnt make sense and I will try to list the ones I remember.

Byron and Gus. Support brawlers with a marksman's range and thrower's bullet width. What is the logic behind them? Like really? They can hit every bullet with ease and they deal stupid damage.

Jessie. Once she placesa turret, good luck she wil cycle endlessly and you wont even be dreaming of killling the turret with close range brawler, yet alone taking her down.

Shade. I think shade should start the match with hypercharge ready, cuz what? it tooks him 3 seconds to recharge it anyway so why bother?

Lou. Absolute madness. Insane range, freeze after 5 succesfull bullet pieces, cover the half of the map with super? Were developers drunk when they designed this?

Piper. If it makes sense to give a brawler 4k+ damage with basic attack at max range, it should also deal 100 damage at best at close range. Oh and, give her automatic aiming gadget? Sure, let one brawler deal 8k+ damage in 2 seconds. Maybe you were lucky enough to get close to her. Well sucks to be you, other gadget pushes you two kilometers away, makinsure Piper has enough time to reload and wreck you. I take back what I said about Lou. Developers were passed out when the creation of Piper was on process.

R-T. Again insane range, enough damage, and when you get close, get wrecked by a weird area attack that would put Jacky to shame.

Rico. Okay I can understand that a brawler with bouncing bullets, perfect for killing targets behind walls. But why the f do they deal more damage when they bounce? Being able to bounc them is OP enough, shouldnt it be balanced with a penalty? Unbeliavable.

Tara. Is there even a way to dodge her super attack? Or survive it?

EMZ and Bo. Area controllers shouldnt be able to deal this much damage and tank this much damage. Is this too much to expect?

Sprout. First time I played against Sprout I thought enemy team is cheating. What the F do you mean bullets are randomly jumping around. What is the purpose of aiming then? Just spam the basic attack and voila. 

Jae-Jong. Another support brawler that you can roam the map without fear. For some reason it runs almost as fast as Max, for some reason his attacks are piercing the targets. For some reaon this brawlers is supposed to make sense.

Griff. Not even Chester can deal 10k damage in a single shot. It can literally one-shot more than 90% of the brawlers with its super attack. Mind you this brawler is a area controller.

Lumi. Now imagine Colt with more bullet width, more damage, more area control and absolutely zero reload speed. There you go, make sense of it.

Berry. I understand recharging super by healing your friends. This is what support is for. But recharhing it while healing yourself? How does that make sense? If you have a wall to hie behind, you are basically immortal.

Kaze. It charges its super and hyper charge so easily, you dont even have to use basic attack. Just blow the screen and Kaze will start jumping on enemies with its ninja form. Easy.

And many others I don't care to mention. Long story short, Brawl Stars make no sense. So I quit before they can annoy me with another broken brawler that they will nerf to the groun once they made the cash. Im talking to you Alli.

Anyway, if you have other game suggestions please hit me up.

Again sorry for the long post. 

Take care everyone.

1oekdmt,"Brawl Stars needs to add a drafting assistant, there are becoming too many brawlers and the average player has no idea how to draft.","So, recently it feels like draft has more impact than it ever has in brawl stars. With how many broken brawlers and hypercharges are in the game currently, it often can feel like you lost the game from the draft screen. This is largely because randoms have no idea how to draft.

  
I suggest adding a drafting assistant to the game. How would it function? By identifying what brawlers the enemy have chosen, it will then suggest you a pick that would potentially counter that brawler. Examples:

1. Lets say you're first pick, it's hard for the drafting assistant to give any suggestion due to being the first pick, so maybe it just suggests brawlers that are generally good in the mode you are playing.

2. Lets say you're second pick after the first brawler has been chosen, lets say they picked an assassin, well it will suggest a brawler good at dealing with assassins, maybe tanks or a brawler like Otis.

3. The final scenario is whenever I feel like a drafting assistant is the most necessary, and that is when you are final pick. The final pick often can completely decide a game, so it's one of the most important. Lets say the enemy has drafted two tanks, the drafting assistant will tell you the two brawlers that are tanks that they have selected, and that you should pick a tank counter, which it would suggest tank counters like Griff or Corde.

Now I know a lot of people don't have a lot of brawlers, though I do think that everybody in mythic has at least 12 brawlers (hopefully all from different classes). I know brawlstars would likely never implement this, but it's just been getting more and more frustrating to play ranked considering over half of the games are decided from the drafting screen. Most players have no clue how to draft and just pick whatever they want on a whim. I guess this drafting assistant may not change that, but it may make some people change their picks.

Day 2: Door 4 - seems to be the one with the hypercharge drop, it will allow everyone to get a new boost for winning and keep the hype (not a punch);

Day 3: Door 9 or 17 - Door 17 seems to be the one with the 10 sushis, but in a scenario that the door 2 don't give us the skin probably door 9 is the second guess for having it;

Day 4: Door 10 - this one looks so mysterious and I think it'll be the one with the ultratrophy box

Day 8: Doors 8, 13 and 6 - Doors 13 and 6 need to be open in the last day so people who already have all brawlers can use it to unlock Ziggy, door 8 seems to be a good one too so it's a good bet.

1oh3wld,Transformers X Brawl Stars concept,"So I was pretty mad last year when I heard Squad Busters got an amazing collab with Transformers while being such a trash game (In my opinion, no hate if you think otherwise). I've taken it into my own hands to make a concept for a Transformers X Brawl Stars collab. It is comprised of 6 skins, 3 Decepticons and 3 Autobots. The main currency of the event is Energon to spend in the in-game shop, which will be themed around Macadam's

--AUTOBOTS--
  
  • Darryl as Optimus Prime (Legendary skin)
    •Why? Because Autobots, roll out!
    •When Darryl rolls with his super, he'll
      transform into the iconic semi truck alt
      mode
     

  •Chuck as Bumblebee (Mythic skin)
   •Why? Because if you've ever played
     Transformers: Angry Birds, you'll get the
     reference
   •Jokes aside, Bumblebee should be a fast,
    diving style brawler and Chuck has that
    needed speed (and wheels)

  
  •Melodie as Elita-1 (Epic skin)
   •Really tough choice here, but I couldn't find
    a better brawler or autobot
   •The dashes would be better suited for
     Elita's motorcycle alt mode


--DECEPTIONS--
 
 •Meg as Megatron (Legendary Skin)
  •Why? First of all, the name (Meg-atron),
    but also the class, which is a tank, and
    Megatron is most known for his tank alt
    mode

  •R-T as Soundwave (Epic skin only because
   R-T has enough Mythic skins already)
   •R-T and his separating super could work
    Really well as Lazerbeak separating from
    Soundwave

   •Angelo as Starscream (Mythic skin)
    •Why? Because it's a flying brawler, which
      fits, plus he's zesty
    •Also Starscream rarely fights up close, 
     Just like Angelo

 The event would last a solid month, with the obvious boss fights, which would be against Unicron and maybe Trypticon? However, a time limited mode would be available as well,
being called Shifty Showdown. It would work as normal Showdown, except everyone is a Cybertronian soldier, and you only have a shoot button and your super. Your gadget is replaced with a transform button that you can use to shift into car mode, which makes you move 40% faster, but you can't attack. You can still heal, however, but you can also still be hurt. The point of this mode is that you don't lose any trophies, but you get the event currency and wins safely.

Everyone have the same starr road and i find that honestly boring especially when you look at how the chromatic brawler were handled with the chroma credits.....wait but THATS IT 

Let me introduce you to the STARR PATH 

What is the Starr Path you might ask? Pretty simple little Tomar 

The Starr Path is your path to be, well....a raising starr and for that youll need brawler for that but why taking the same path as all the other you are you and they are they.

Enough foreplay, the Starr Path would be a way to unlock brawler the way we want to do, because as of now as i stated its the same path for everyone and lets say you want juju but are a f2p, you have to luck or to wait many many MANYYYY well even too many brawler and when you look at how the end of the road is looking all red mythic mythic mythic its just tasteless. The starrpath could work like the chromatic brawler were handle, an old brawler like leon would take lets say 3 mythic and 5 epic on your account to be able to choose him, spike, or crow 

As for a more recent uni legendary such as Kenji (he is in door 6, colette told me), youd need 6 mythic and 10 epics to or lets say 5 mythic and 7 epics and preferably a legendary or 2 before. It would let people, casual, new or returning player to have theyre own choice have theyre own....path

From my experience his damage output is way to high for a support. At level 11 when I hit both projectiles it is 2800 dmg and 8400 if all ammo and all projectiles are being hit, which is enough to bring down a lot of brawlers.

I think Ruffs has potential to be a great support. I'd like to see the hp increase of his support SP being buffed to distinguish him as a support.
And i'd even like to do something about his super being way too rewarding used offensively rather than being rewarding to aim to buff yourself or your teammates.

She has 8.2k health with a stu ult worth of movement on every basic attack. I think the answer here is a health nerf. Her damage is fine but take her max health down to something around 6k or maybe just a little more. I really think this would be better. Right now shes just not really approachable by dives because she has a nice health pool and great mobility to get away in time before dying while killing the dive with a burst of 8k damage (not even mentioning the knockup ult), and shes terrible for ranged brawlers because she can dodge ever projectile on reaction with a basic attack side step, hitting you while you cant hit her(along with a gadget that just flat out blocks projectiles). I would pretty a squishier health pool to reduced movement or increase basic attack cooldown cause i think her movement mechanics are fun. Its just the movement while being tanky and high damage doesnt feel good to play against at all

1ogck1k,XP Doublers Rework Concept,"The problem with XP Doublers now is that the number of doublers you have now essentially equals to the number of XPs you'll get eventually. So say for example you own 1000 XP Doublers, eventually after they are used up you earn 1000 more XPs. So why don't they just give you the XP directly in the first place?

My rework concept is to make the XP Doubler count as number of matches they'll be activating. For example after the rework you have 5 XP Doublers, so for the upcoming 5 matches, all XP earned including quests will be doubled. This will make XP Doublers more rewarding and also encourage players to finish quests.

1og7hh1,Opinions on the hypercharge change?,"I think the hypercharge change is bad, even though it’s a step in the right direction I think it’s a bad change and doesn’t really fix what I believe is the biggest issue with hypercharges. 

It’s a good start to making hypercharges more balanced but it doesnt fix what I believe as the main issue being some hypercharges are just fundamentally overpowered / way to strong and its just going to make brawlers with a bad hypercharge effects even worse because they won’t even get good stat boosts from using it.

For example, even though all hypercharges are getting “nerfed” brawlers like Mortis, Kenji and Ollie have extremely strong hypercharge effects and regardless of how much extra damage they get from it it would still be strong without the stat boosts. However brawlers like Pearl, Sprout and Charlie and other brawlers that have fundamentally bad hypercharges that get almost zero value 90% of the time need the stat boosts to get value and they’re getting an unnecessary nerf to their already bad hypercharges. (I understand Charlie is pretty good in the meta but her hypercharge isn’t good)

This change is going to be good to tone down other extremely good hypercharges like kenji and Ollie but it will also harm other already bad hypercharges and that’s why I don’t think the change is that good and I feel like their could’ve been a better way to do this.

Also giving a 25% speed boost to all hypercharges almost only helps the tanks / assassins brawlers who have been running the meta for so long now and it’s almost does nothing to tone down the overpowered hypercharges because getting hit by them is basically a guaranteed kill because of how they work and not just the damage / shield boost 

But what do you guys think? Overall I think the change is bad even though it’s a step in the right direction it’s possibly the worst first step they could’ve taken that isn’t just removing hypercharges entirely but that wouldn’t be as bad as this in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og7hh1/opinions_on_the_hypercharge_change/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og7hh1/opinions_on_the_hypercharge_change/,6,1761439828.0,text_only,,Feedback/Rant,Anger,"The user is expressing strong negative sentiment, stating multiple times that they believe the hypercharge change is 'bad' and 'possibly the worst first step'.

1ojeoke,New brawler idea for an aggressive thrower,"I got bored and decided to create an idea for a new brawler. There isn't really a dedicated aggressive thrower so I decided to make one. Forgive me if this brawler is too op 💔

Name: Nihil

Brawler type: Artillery 

Description: 
Nihil is a veteran. Or at least that's what he likes to think. Hundreds of applications to join the military, and not one has been accepted... 



Stats (power level 11):

Health: 5000

Movement speed: Fast

Main attack: Grenade Toss

Nihil throws a grenade, dealing explosion damage upon contact with a surface. Grenades also have shrapnel, potentially dealing extra damage within explosion range. Nihil can also use the explosion of the grenades to propel himself very far, at the cost of 500 health. Nihil can attack while airborne.

Explosion damage: 2250

Shrapnel damage: 250 x 6

Range: Long

Reload speed: Very Fast

Ammo count: 3

Explosion launch distance: 10 tiles 



Super: Supply Drop

Nihil calls in a supply drop, falling from the sky and upon landing breaks open, dealing 2000 damage to nearby enemies and dropping three MRE rations. Upon contact, each MRE ration heals Nihil for 50% of his max health and friendly brawlers for 33% of their max health. Many MRE rations can be out at once, as long as Nihil can get multiple supers. 

Super range: Very long

Damage to charge super: 8000



Special gears: Extra Shrapnel

Each grenade has 4 extra shards of shrapnel 



Gadgets:

Gadget #1: Smoke Grenade 

Nihil's next attack throws a smoke grenade instead of a regular grenade, which deals no damage but covers a large area in smoke, which conceals him and his team from enemy brawlers for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 20 seconds.

Gadget #2: Artillery Arm

Nihil's next attack has its range, damage, and explosion radius increased by 50%. It also propels him twice as far.

Cooldown: 15 seconds.



Star powers: 

Star power #1: Pocket Rations

Every 3 seconds, Nihil consumes a ration from his pocket, healing 50% of his max health.

Star power #2: Explosive Vest

When Nihil's health drops below 50%, his vest explodes, dealing 4000 damage to nearby enemy brawlers and knocking them back. 

Hypercharge: Rational Rationing

Nihil's super now drops 6 rations instead of only 3. Each ration heals twice as much, and they can overheal up to 6000. Each ration also boosts damage and speed by +10% for 8 seconds, which can stack with other rations.

Damage to charge hyper: 30000

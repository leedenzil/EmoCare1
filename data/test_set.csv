1ofw24n,Opinions on the Brawl Talk?,"in my opinion, i think this might help revive the game. My top 3 things are

3: XP doublers for quests, do i even need to explain? Everyone wanted this!


HM: the new trio game modes. Although i dont think gem grab will work super well, i have more faith in trio wipeout, which i think will be in my top game modes OAT.

2: the new random 6 wins = 6 rewards (that can differ)! Its something i enjoy from this event, so seeing it stay with some different things, INCLUDING different boxes, is something i like, and honestly, you cant complain about rewards! I am also wondering what the mech box is


HM 2: Mega quests. Really worth it IMO. Good rewards, for some quests you can grind through. I enjoy this!

1: my favorite thing is the upside down showdown! i personally like all the power ups (for example mutations and angel powers), but the only thing that i didnt like was that it sometimes forced you to play other game modes when you didnt feel like playing with the powers.

Upside down showdown works because normal showdown still exists, and the powers work best in showdown. 

Another thing thats cool is that its esentially the idea for powers for mutations and angels/demons combined.

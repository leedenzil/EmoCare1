So it does better, and people don’t like it…right? He made a poll a few days ago asking if they liked the pictures or not. And three fourth people like it. So, the video gets more views and people like it, win-win, right?

No. So many posts, so many of them about how they don’t like the thumbnails, bruh, Y’ALL ARE THE ONE WHO AGREED! Besides, once again, the pics aren’t even that bad!

This makes me remember that one reddit post about a simple pic of a game character (totally normal) and people started making funny threads that go like “I saw the pic and started m*sturbating in the train, and accidentally dropped the phone. Now everybody saw this in the train and m*sturbated together with me!”

And the thread went on about how people were saying they read this and started m*sturbating too. Where’s that mature mentality of taking jokes as jokes and brushing it off? “Snakethug stooped so low” tf he did not. 3 of the 4 people who reads this are totally fine with it.

Besides, if we can’t look at an ai slop of a video game charcater without getting rock hard, we might as well stop watching him.

1krh7hf,Rework Ideas for Terrible/Mediocre Hypercharges,"These are just some ideas I had that I wanted to share. Apologies if I listed some things that another person already posted about. I am no game designer and haven’t thought about these in too much detail, but I just wanted to hear some thoughts on these concepts 💜


First, I will start with all brawlers who absolutely NEED a hypercharge rework:


Gene: Super has infinite range and travels faster, but pulls back at a normal speed

Mico: His hypercharge duration freezes from when he uses his super to when he lands. This solves his hypercharge’s main issue of being wasted when using his super

Charlie: Her cocoon has more health and decays much slower. This forces a teammate to break open the cocoon if they don’t want to lose the captured person for a decent chunk of time. Yes, this would be very strong in 1v1 situations

Sprout: Places a permanent unbreakable wall that can only be destroyed by his transplant gadget or by round reset. This wall cannot be placed on or around spawn or directly in front of the goal

Pearl: Shoots out burning cookies all around her that do considerable damage, destroy cover, and leave a burning area where they landed. These cookies are intended to hit brawlers knocked back by her super

Willow: Her mind control lasts for 6-8 seconds (instead of 4), she can use the controlled brawlers super, and gets to keep the immunity shield. If the brawler she mind controls does not have super when hit, that brawler will instantly gain their super so Willow can use it

Nani: Her super goes through walls, does more damage (stacked with the hypercharge damage buff and autofocus star power), and she gains and immunity shield until Peep detonates

Brock: His super fires more rockets (stacks with more rockets star power), fires them faster, and each individual rocket will damage anything within his super’s radius, rather than having their own range


Now, I will list some brawlers who have mediocre hypercharges that don’t need to be reworked, but could be changed or added on to:


El Primo: Travels faster when jumping, has a larger super area, and calls down small meteors where he lands

Shelly, Colt, and Spike: All three of these hypercharges are solid, but I feel like they could do something else along with making their supers bigger. Shelly’s hypercharge would heal her for 50%  of the damage dealt by her super to anyone it hits, Colt’s hypercharge would slow down anyone it hits, and Spikes hypercharge would heal him and his teammates when standing in it. (Spike’s healing from his hypercharge would stack with his fertilizer star power)

Otis: I don’t believe his hypercharge is bad at all, but I feel like a nice add on would be to make his hypercharge super bigger

Bull: He should keep his 80% damage reduction shield a few seconds after his super is over

Jacky: Has a larger super radius and destroys all cover around her


Those are all the brawlers that I feel need to or could have their hypercharge changed/added on to.
I would love to know what people think about these ideas. Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading :)

1kd5egn,Why can't event skins go to the skin vault?,"The Katana Kingdom event started yesterday, and I already got the only skin I can get through drops (Ash) since I don't have any other Brawlers who have event skins.
I honestly don't understand why Supercell can't use the skin vault. It's a mechanic that already exists in the game, but they never use it. In the Pizza Planet event, they used the excuse that the vault mechanic was only designed for skins from the season pass. But then they used it in the Uno collaboration. And now they're using it again, but only with Kenji. Proving that they can actually use it outside of the event skins. I'm not saying they should use it all the time, but in events where the skins are exclusive and the Brawlers who have one skin are mostly Mythic, I feel like they could use the vault.
For example, I wanted to get the Mothra skin for Eve, but I didn't have Eve and she was too far away on the Starr Road. I got it in a drop a couple of days after the Mothra skin was no longer available. I feel like if they don't want to use the vault, they could at least give the option to unlock the brawler in Starr Road, like they do with new brawlers. After a certain time in Starr Road, the order doesn't really make sense, other than the order in which the brawlers arrive. So I don't see why they couldn't make it so that the brawlers who get special skins that season can be unlocked before the rest. It would be like those events they did to unlock the brawlers who will have a skin in the season pass, but less expensive for them, since they wouldn't be ""giving away"" anything, while also benefiting players who don't yet have the brawler.",https://i.redd.it/qv4i0wvjbeye1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1kd5egn/why_cant_event_skins_go_to_the_skin_vault/,7,1746203649.0,image,media\images\1kd5egn.jpeg,Feedback/Rant,Sadness,"The user expresses disappointment and frustration with Supercell's inconsistent use of the 'skin vault' feature and the challenges in acquiring event skins for Brawlers they don't own.

1ojeoke,New brawler idea for an aggressive thrower,"I got bored and decided to create an idea for a new brawler. There isn't really a dedicated aggressive thrower so I decided to make one. Forgive me if this brawler is too op 💔

Name: Nihil

Brawler type: Artillery 

Description: 
Nihil is a veteran. Or at least that's what he likes to think. Hundreds of applications to join the military, and not one has been accepted... 



Stats (power level 11):

Health: 5000

Movement speed: Fast

Main attack: Grenade Toss

Nihil throws a grenade, dealing explosion damage upon contact with a surface. Grenades also have shrapnel, potentially dealing extra damage within explosion range. Nihil can also use the explosion of the grenades to propel himself very far, at the cost of 500 health. Nihil can attack while airborne.

Explosion damage: 2250

Shrapnel damage: 250 x 6

Range: Long

Reload speed: Very Fast

Ammo count: 3

Explosion launch distance: 10 tiles 



Super: Supply Drop

Nihil calls in a supply drop, falling from the sky and upon landing breaks open, dealing 2000 damage to nearby enemies and dropping three MRE rations. Upon contact, each MRE ration heals Nihil for 50% of his max health and friendly brawlers for 33% of their max health. Many MRE rations can be out at once, as long as Nihil can get multiple supers. 

Super range: Very long

Damage to charge super: 8000



Special gears: Extra Shrapnel

Each grenade has 4 extra shards of shrapnel 



Gadgets:

Gadget #1: Smoke Grenade 

Nihil's next attack throws a smoke grenade instead of a regular grenade, which deals no damage but covers a large area in smoke, which conceals him and his team from enemy brawlers for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 20 seconds.

Gadget #2: Artillery Arm

Nihil's next attack has its range, damage, and explosion radius increased by 50%. It also propels him twice as far.

Cooldown: 15 seconds.



Star powers: 

Star power #1: Pocket Rations

Every 3 seconds, Nihil consumes a ration from his pocket, healing 50% of his max health.

Star power #2: Explosive Vest

When Nihil's health drops below 50%, his vest explodes, dealing 4000 damage to nearby enemy brawlers and knocking them back. 

Hypercharge: Rational Rationing

Nihil's super now drops 6 rations instead of only 3. Each ration heals twice as much, and they can overheal up to 6000. Each ration also boosts damage and speed by +10% for 8 seconds, which can stack with other rations.

Damage to charge hyper: 30000

1kkmsnm,I expected this bug after Stu and Crow had it,"So the new Hypercharges once again made something broken. This one’s probably the stupidest of them all, but it isn’t even tied to a skin this time

So if you didn’t know, Crow and Stu have specific effects from their attacks/super (Poison and Fire respectively) that is sometimes changed from different skins. Because Hypercharges add “base skin” supers and only HC Skins get special Hypercharge Supers, this resulted in various skins belonging to them becoming P2W as a result due to stacking effects.

Because Amber ALSO applies status with her Super, I half expected Frost Queen Amber to have the same bug, and sure enough, there it is. However, just testing it I discovered BASE Amber also has the bug, because apparently the Hypercharge fire is _different_ from the normal fire. If you can catch a Brawler with both the Hypercharge and Regular Supers, you deal 2450 tick damage for 4 ticks. 9800 Damage. If you get caught you’re dead. It outright kills a majority of the Brawlers in the game.

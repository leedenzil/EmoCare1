1kj7v6b,We HAVE to stop pointlessly hating.,"Many people are hating on Snake for including inappropriate (not really) thumbnails. While this is true and I myself am not a fan of it, if you look at his sus thumbnails, most of them have more than 500k views.

So it does better, and people don’t like it…right? He made a poll a few days ago asking if they liked the pictures or not. And three fourth people like it. So, the video gets more views and people like it, win-win, right?

No. So many posts, so many of them about how they don’t like the thumbnails, bruh, Y’ALL ARE THE ONE WHO AGREED! Besides, once again, the pics aren’t even that bad!

This makes me remember that one reddit post about a simple pic of a game character (totally normal) and people started making funny threads that go like “I saw the pic and started m*sturbating in the train, and accidentally dropped the phone. Now everybody saw this in the train and m*sturbated together with me!”

And the thread went on about how people were saying they read this and started m*sturbating too. Where’s that mature mentality of taking jokes as jokes and brushing it off? “Snakethug stooped so low” tf he did not. 3 of the 4 people who reads this are totally fine with it.

Besides, if we can’t look at an ai slop of a video game charcater without getting rock hard, we might as well stop watching him.

1kkmsnm,I expected this bug after Stu and Crow had it,"So the new Hypercharges once again made something broken. This one’s probably the stupidest of them all, but it isn’t even tied to a skin this time

So if you didn’t know, Crow and Stu have specific effects from their attacks/super (Poison and Fire respectively) that is sometimes changed from different skins. Because Hypercharges add “base skin” supers and only HC Skins get special Hypercharge Supers, this resulted in various skins belonging to them becoming P2W as a result due to stacking effects.

Because Amber ALSO applies status with her Super, I half expected Frost Queen Amber to have the same bug, and sure enough, there it is. However, just testing it I discovered BASE Amber also has the bug, because apparently the Hypercharge fire is _different_ from the normal fire. If you can catch a Brawler with both the Hypercharge and Regular Supers, you deal 2450 tick damage for 4 ticks. 9800 Damage. If you get caught you’re dead.

>Use Pins and sprays in-game to express ***your*** emotions.

Do you remember the true meaning of pins? Showing **YOUR OWN** emotions and how YOU feel about the situation.

Do we intentionally use happy pins when only someone else is happy? 

Obviously, we don't. We use them to show that **we** are happy, not others. Then why for the clown pin people think that it implies literally the opposite?

That also spreads to monkey pins. They reference the old phrase ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" (basically, don't think or do evil things). But these are literally used for evil, ""to show that enemy is a monkey"".

With this in mind, if you use clown pin, then **you** feel like a clown. If you use monkey pin, it would depend on the gesture (you don't wanna see/hear/speak).

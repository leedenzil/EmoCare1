    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- ⚡ **10-15x faster** with concurrent API calls\n",
    "- ✅ Interruptible process (can stop and resume anytime)\n",
    "- ✅ Progress is saved after each batch\n",
    "- ✅ Skips already-labeled posts automatically\n",
    "- ✅ Rate limiting to respect API limits\n",
    "- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speed Comparison:**\n",
    "- Sequential: 1,000 posts in ~60 minutes\n",
    "- **Concurrent (this): 1,000 posts in ~8-15 minutes** 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: `data/raw_data.csv` (from Notebook 01)\n",

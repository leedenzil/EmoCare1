Hi there,

Thanks for playing and reaching out to us!

We greatly appreciate you taking the time to report this.

We’re aware of the issue, and our game team is doing its best to solve it as soon as possible. Furthermore, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.

Meanwhile: depending on your device, remember to check Apple's App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). This way you can make sure you’ve installed any recent important updates.

Have a great day!

——-

The staff respond the same everytime with the copy and paste and nothing is being done about it. 

For us with the broken streaks - we are a community. And there are many of us. We have tried many things including: different devices, different accounts (where the streaks work fine on the same device), restarting app/phone, uninstalling app, updating operating system, etc. 

The ONLY way this will ever get fixed is by continuing to contact support! Contact by email - usually they will either ignore you or tell you to contact in game but sometimes you get a rep who says he’ll pass it onto his supervisor THATS what we want!

Supercell is a multibillion dollar company with many different games! Unless a bug causes players to gain resources Supercell doesn’t make it a priority! So keep reporting! 

We must unity broken streaks community! Stay strong!

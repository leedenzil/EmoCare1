1nv6ldv,New monthly flairs! Please read before suggesting.,"Hello again, it’s been a minute since the last drop of flairs. (We did the first 2 drops back to back so we could start releasing on the first of every month.)

FLAIRS

Special thanks to u/Qubelek for the iconic Tomar753 suggestion, and to u/Aggressive-War-3260 for the sarcastic King of Hot Zone suggestion. We do value your opinions and would like to hear suggestions.

That being said, there are some things we should say first before you suggest anything. Firstly, please try to suggest a brawler without a special flair yet (spread the love). As great as it would be to have multiple ironic Edgar flairs, it would be awesome to have some flairs for the less loved brawlers such as Otis. 

Once the release date for Ziggy is confirmed we will release his flair. (Don’t worry, we didn’t forget)

OTHER THINGS

We are always on the lookout for great moderator candidates. You can never have too many, especially in a big sub like this 😉. 

Special thanks to the PLProdigy team for making the awesome new draft feature, you guys rock! 

Any questions you guys have feel free to ask.

1ohcvy4,Ruffs is currently not a support,"So basically the title. I gave Ruffs a go and carried most of the games I played. I am not gonna pretend I am pro, or even play at that level. This is solely based on my trip from 560 -> 700 trophies.

From my experience his damage output is way to high for a support. At level 11 when I hit both projectiles it is 2800 dmg and 8400 if all ammo and all projectiles are being hit, which is enough to bring down a lot of brawlers.

I think Ruffs has potential to be a great support. I'd like to see the hp increase of his support SP being buffed to distinguish him as a support.
And i'd even like to do something about his super being way too rewarding used offensively rather than being rewarding to aim to buff yourself or your teammates.

1oharzz,Ducktales event idea,"**Why?**

With a lot of 80's stuff getting referenced in the new update (not just because of the current IP, but also the gym skins having the same 80's vibe), I think it's possible that with Christmas we're getting a Ducktales event, due to Scrooge McDuck being based on Ebenezer Scrooge from the famous A Christmas Carol. Though this theory and my ""evidence"" for it is centered around the 1987 show, I think the event would primarily be based around the 2017 reboot.

Edit: turns out a Mecha season is for December. It could still be for January while the Scrooge skin is given out during Christmas.

**Skins**

* Mico as Scrooge McDuck. Free Epic skin. Mico was free during the Christmas event in 2023 and this is a good way to reference the well-known pogo-jumping mechanic from the NES Ducktales game.
* Cordelius as Donald Duck. Mythic skin. They both wear a hat and have a cape-like thing. If Donald's hat gets very exaggerated, it can fit into Cordelius' silhouette. They're also a bit difficult to understand voice-wise.
* Doug as Huey. Brawl Pass skin, Dewey and Louie reskins. Gus has recently gotten a skin so using Gus once again for a collab skin can come off as ""industry-planting"". Maybe it can be Lena carrying the corresponding triplet on her shoulders, as I can't think of any other way of representing her without increasing the number of skins to an unrealistic amount. The hotdog is replaced by a Pep soda can.
* Nani and Peep as Webby and Launchpad. Epic skin. Nani already has a duck-like skin (Sally Nani) and this is a pretty decent way to reference the running gag of Launchpad not being the best pilot while still being very reliable.
* Pam as Miss Beakley. Super Rare skin. They're both big women and this skin can be considered profitable, especially if Pam gets her promised rework during this collab.
* (Optional) Griff as Flintheart Glomgold. They're both greedy and I think Griff's personality and more chunky body fits better with Glomgold than Scrooge.
* Lola as Magica de Spell. Hypercharge, Vesuvian (red) and Tulpafire (blue) recolors. They're both egotistical, maniacal, and the Ego can be a stand-in for Magica's shadow, though her shadow behaving on its own is more of a Lorcana thing. The Hypercharge form can reference the wyvern transformation seen in the Nightmare on Killmotor Hill episode. Also black and purple are very prominent on Magica's color scheme, and we all know that the younger side of the playerbase loves skins that contain black and purple as prominent colors.

**Gamemodes:**

* Bot hunt. It's like Robo Rumble, but there's no Heist Safe so it's purely about survival. The bots are also much stronger and you need to collect the bolts they drop to confirm the bots as taken down.
* Ultimate Showdown. Showdown but with 12 players. To accommodate for having to deal with more opponents and make Brawler viability within this gamemode more consistent, Power Cubes and Ruffs' Power-Up boost HP by a percentage of the maximum HP with a minimum of the default HP boost.
* 5v5 Brawl Arena. It's like Brawl Arena, but 5v5. Towers and Base have double HP, deal 35% more damage and have shields.
* Boss Fight. Possible bosses consist of: Oni Kenji, Spirit Knight Frank, Scorpion Chuck, Kraken Surge and Magica Lola. Magica Lola also has a ""Hyper Boss"" Hyper Magica Lola variant with doubled Normal difficulty HP (HP increase per difficulty is still only 30k) and attacks that unload faster so she can cycle her attacks more often, but Hypercharges of all Brawlers are pernamently active, Gadgets recharge twice as fast, Brawlers passively recover HP twice as fast and Energy Drinks can spawn.

**Shop**

With a new currency you get from Daily Wins, Daily Reward Chain, Quests and Boss Fights, you're able to buy Treasure Boxes and guaranteed skins from Funzo's Fun Zone. After spending a certain high amount of this temporary currency, you'll obtain Magica Lola for free. Treasure Boxes can contain cosmetics from Once Upon (some of the more evil skins from that theme to be specific), Dark Sands, Sands of Time (Shelly Dancer, Dynasty Mike and Dark Samurai Gene excluded), Cursed Pirates, Gym Rats, Brawlidays, Dark Brawlidays and Ducktales.

To wreak havoc on Starr Park and in an attempt to get Scrooge's Dime, the now Kaiju-sized Magica Lola summons Spirit Knight Frank and reincarnates Kizu Kenji back to Oni Kenji. She gets assisted by Scorpion Chuck and Kraken Surge, both of which have also become Kaiju-sized for an unknown reason.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oharzz/ducktales_event_idea/,3,1761560787.0,text_only,,Art/Concept,Neutral/Other,"The user is proposing a highly detailed and comprehensive 'Ducktales event idea' for Brawl Stars.

1oh3wld,Transformers X Brawl Stars concept,"So I was pretty mad last year when I heard Squad Busters got an amazing collab with Transformers while being such a trash game (In my opinion, no hate if you think otherwise). I've taken it into my own hands to make a concept for a Transformers X Brawl Stars collab. It is comprised of 6 skins, 3 Decepticons and 3 Autobots. The main currency of the event is Energon to spend in the in-game shop, which will be themed around Macadam's

--AUTOBOTS--
  
  • Darryl as Optimus Prime (Legendary skin)
    •Why? Because Autobots, roll out!
    •When Darryl rolls with his super, he'll
      transform into the iconic semi truck alt
      mode
     

  •Chuck as Bumblebee (Mythic skin)
   •Why? Because if you've ever played
     Transformers: Angry Birds, you'll get the
     reference
   •Jokes aside, Bumblebee should be a fast,
    diving style brawler and Chuck has that
    needed speed (and wheels)

  
  •Melodie as Elita-1 (Epic skin)
   •Really tough choice here, but I couldn't find
    a better brawler or autobot
   •The dashes would be better suited for
     Elita's motorcycle alt mode


--DECEPTIONS--
 
 •Meg as Megatron (Legendary Skin)
  •Why? First of all, the name (Meg-atron),
    but also the class, which is a tank, and
    Megatron is most known for his tank alt
    mode

  •R-T as Soundwave (Epic skin only because
   R-T has enough Mythic skins already)
   •R-T and his separating super could work
    Really well as Lazerbeak separating from
    Soundwave

   •Angelo as Starscream (Mythic skin)
    •Why? Because it's a flying brawler, which
      fits, plus he's zesty
    •Also Starscream rarely fights up close, 
     Just like Angelo

 The event would last a solid month, with the obvious boss fights, which would be against Unicron and maybe Trypticon? However, a time limited mode would be available as well,
being called Shifty Showdown. It would work as normal Showdown, except everyone is a Cybertronian soldier, and you only have a shoot button and your super. Your gadget is replaced with a transform button that you can use to shift into car mode, which makes you move 40% faster, but you can't attack. You can still heal, however, but you can also still be hurt. The point of this mode is that you don't lose any trophies, but you get the event currency and wins safely.

1og7hh1,Opinions on the hypercharge change?,"I think the hypercharge change is bad, even though it’s a step in the right direction I think it’s a bad change and doesn’t really fix what I believe is the biggest issue with hypercharges. 

It’s a good start to making hypercharges more balanced but it doesnt fix what I believe as the main issue being some hypercharges are just fundamentally overpowered / way to strong and its just going to make brawlers with a bad hypercharge effects even worse because they won’t even get good stat boosts from using it.

For example, even though all hypercharges are getting “nerfed” brawlers like Mortis, Kenji and Ollie have extremely strong hypercharge effects and regardless of how much extra damage they get from it it would still be strong without the stat boosts. However brawlers like Pearl, Sprout and Charlie and other brawlers that have fundamentally bad hypercharges that get almost zero value 90% of the time need the stat boosts to get value and they’re getting an unnecessary nerf to their already bad hypercharges. (I understand Charlie is pretty good in the meta but her hypercharge isn’t good)

This change is going to be good to tone down other extremely good hypercharges like kenji and Ollie but it will also harm other already bad hypercharges and that’s why I don’t think the change is that good and I feel like their could’ve been a better way to do this.

Also giving a 25% speed boost to all hypercharges almost only helps the tanks / assassins brawlers who have been running the meta for so long now and it’s almost does nothing to tone down the overpowered hypercharges because getting hit by them is basically a guaranteed kill because of how they work and not just the damage / shield boost 

But what do you guys think? Overall I think the change is bad even though it’s a step in the right direction it’s possibly the worst first step they could’ve taken that isn’t just removing hypercharges entirely but that wouldn’t be as bad as this in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og7hh1/opinions_on_the_hypercharge_change/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og7hh1/opinions_on_the_hypercharge_change/,6,1761439828.0,text_only,,Feedback/Rant,Anger,"The user is expressing strong negative sentiment, stating multiple times that they believe the hypercharge change is 'bad' and 'possibly the worst first step'.

1og7y6i,Another little Kaze fanfic I made(sequel),"

Title: Kaze learns Chess II.

…..And after I challenged Kaze to another chess match, she accepted. 1 turned into 2, 2 turned into 10, and 10 turned into 30 chess matches. By the time we finished our chess matches, it was already 7 am! Kaze: “What the-it’s morning already?! What time is it?!” Me: “7 am. How are we not tired-“ Me and Kaze suddenly doze off to sleep, most likely due to the fact that we both stayed up all night playing chess. 

(Timeskip to a few hours later.)
, Kaze splashed a bucket of water on me, both waking me up…and getting my clothes wet…..Me: “Ah! Cold! Cold!” I then look at my wet clothes. “Hey! You ruined my clothes!” Kaze chuckles, and then shows me one of her kimonos. Kaze: “Don’t worry, you can wear one of my kimonos!” I get a tad bit flustered. Me: “B-but kimonos are for girls-“ I then realize that I ether have to wear one of her kimonos, or have to wear wet, cold clothes. Me: “…Nevermind…I accept.” I put on the kimono, and it was surprisingly cozy! Me: “Hm. It actually isn’t that bad wearing a kimono.” I then realize what I said, and I cover up my mouth. Kaze: “Awww…you look so cute in that Kimono!” I start blushing and getting flustered, and I try to change the topic. Me: “W-well, what do you want to do today?” A smile forms on Kaze’s face. Kaze: “Let’s meet at the park later today. Get prepared, you look disheveled. And bring your chessboard.”

  I then leave her house. and I go back to my house. When I get to my house, I fix my hair, and straighten the kimono she gave me, since I indeed looked disheveled. After I did all of that, I started making a little present for Kaze(a chess-themed crown) because I’m becoming increasingly moonstruck with her. After an hour, I finish the crown, and put it in a box with wrapping paper. 

(Timeskip to a few hours later, and I come to the park)

 When I get to the park, I see Kaze at one of the picnic tables, and I sit across from her. Kaze: “Still wearing that Kimono, are we? I knew you would love it!” I blush, and I show her a box. Me: “I brought a little surprise for you!” Kaze then opens the box, and sees the crown I made for her. Kaze: “T-this is beautiful! I love it!” I then looked at her in the eyes. Me: “I have something to confess…” Kaze: “What is it?” With a nervous look on my face, I prepare to confess to her. “I….love you.” Kaze pulls out a rose, and puts it in my hands. Kaze: “Well…I love you too!” Kaze then pulls me to her to my engage in a long, passionate kiss….

After a minute, we finally pull away from the kiss.
Me: “So, since we love eachother, do you want to be a couple?” Kaze instantly replies: “Sure! Let’s play a few more chess matches to celebrate our love!”

1og4kjw,"An in-depth analysis on everything Upside Showdown does wrong, and how to fix it","TL;DR at the bottom

Hey everyone, I'm a longtime Brawl Stars player who also happens to play a lot of roguelites. Before I begin, I'll dump a few qualifications to prove that I know what I'm talking about. I have a winstreak of 3 on A20H in Slay the Spire, C+ in Balatro, and all combinations divine victory in Monster Train. So I'm pretty good at roguelites.

I have quite a few criticisms about the new Upside Showdown mode announced in today's Brawl Talk, and I want to talk about them here, to explain exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

# Part 1: Metaprogression and Unlocks

A lot of roguelites feature some sort of unlock or metaprogression system---when you first start playing the game, you won't have access to all possible abilities and you won't be at your full power.

For the sake of this post, I'll define ""unlocks"" as abilities that you won't be able to get when you first play the game, but you'll be able to permanently unlock them after doing certain things and you will be able to encounter them in future runs (e.g. card and relic unlocks in Slay the Spire). ""Metaprogression"" is a way to permanently buff the playable character(s) that carries in between runs (e.g. upgrades and golden eggs in Vampire Survivors). 

However, basically every good roguelite follow a few principles for metaprogression.

Firstly, any and all unlocks are guaranteed. What this means is that all unlockable abilities are unlocked by the same requirements no matter what. In Monster Train, for example, the score that you get for each run is converted into XP, which will level up the clans that you finished that run with. Each level for each clan unlocks a fixed set of cards and relics that you will be able to find in your future runs. There is zero randomness in the system.

Secondly, the player has a choice in their metaprogression. In other words, the player chooses what buffs they grant to which character. In Vampire Survivors, for example, the player can choose which upgrades to purchase using gold they earn in each run. The player also chooses which playable character they can assign golden eggs. 

Thirdly, all unlocks and metaprogression are ""grindable."" If the player plays infinitely, they will be able to acquire all unlocks and permanent upgrades. Moreover, almost all roguelikes also allow the player to unlock fast. Slay the Spire requires you to play 3-4 runs with each of the 4 characters to earn enough XP to unlock everything. Each run takes maybe 45 minutes.

All three of these are necessary to make a roguelite fun. Players don't want to have their abilities gated behind RNG; it's frustrating and unfun. Players also want to have the ability to unlock all their abilities through playing the game---only being able to unlock, say, 1 ability per day is incredibly annoying and limits what the player can do. 

Brawl Stars happens to do *none* of these three. There doesn't appear to be any metaprogression in Upside, so I'll ignore that for now, but the cards that players choose in-game are unlocked through card packs that are purchased with waffles, which are a limited currency (unless, of course, you shell out real money). Players will be able to play with a limited selection of abilities, which greatly restricts the freedom they have when choosing brawlers and builds (although due to other reasons, this might not even be relevant, and not in a good way).

# Part 2: PvP

The roguelite genre in general is often criticized as being too RNG-based. People often claim that roguelites require no skill and that you often get ""unwinnable runs"" and that they got screwed over by RNG.

However, this is not true. (For most roguelites, at least.) What makes roguelites not RNG-based is the fact that *roguelites are PvE.* This means that players will always know what possible enemies and bosses are coming, and how to prepare for it. More importantly, however, the player knows how strong they have to be. They don't have to become some unkillable god that can basically stand still and win---they can barely scrape their way through with the help of consumable items and intense micro, and in either case, it counts as a victory.

I'll use Slay the Spire as such an example. For reference, StS is a notably hard game. Around two-thirds of all people who download the game ever win a single run. Around 16% of the players reach Ascension 10, and less than 8% of all players ever beat Ascension 20, the highest difficulty in the game. Slay the Spire also has an optional superboss called the Heart that is not only more difficult than any other fight in the game by a long shot, but also requires the player to give up one card upgrade, one relic, and fight an extra-dangerous elite fight. Around 15% of players have beaten this boss at any difficulty. In other words, A20H (Ascension 20 Heart) is extremely difficult. There aren't any statistics on how many people have beaten it, but it's probably less than 5%. The players who did beat it also probably took many attempts--it's known that the A20 no heart winrate is less than 10%, so A20H is most likely even lower. Again, I don't have the exact numbers, but I do know that it took me 32 attempts to beat A20H when I first attempted, so maybe around 3%. 

Despite this difficulty, despite all the criticism of the game for being too difficult, it is still almost always winnable with perfect play. The best player in the world has achieved a winstreak of 26 on A20H while rotating between all four characters, and someone has achieved a winstreak of 53 (and still going!) with the Watcher, which is generally considered the strongest of the four characters. In fact, it took over four years to find the first truly unwinnable seed in Slay the Spire, and that is only unwinnable on Ascension 18 or above, and only on one of the four characters.

The point of the last two paragraphs was that roguelites aren't RNG-based---because the enemies you fight are fixed, because almost all roguelites are PvE, you can prepare for them in advance and know what abilities are most suited.

Brawl Stars is a PvP game, however, and this means that the roguelite mode is in fact completely RNG-based. You no longer have to reach a fixed bar---instead, you have to make sure that you are better than six of the nine other players in your lobby. And this is completely out of your control. You can make the best decisions and the best play at every possible moment and still lose, sometimes in crushing fashion. And that just isn't fun. 

Brawl Stars is a skill-based game. If you are mechanically better than your enemies and you draft properly, you have a very good chance at winning. Roguelites are mostly skill-based games. If you make the best decision at each point in time, or at least a reasonably good one, you will most likely win your run. However, Upside Showdown, a multiplayer PvP roguelite gamemode in Brawl Stars, is not a skill-based game. You can be the best player in your lobby, pick the best cards at every point in time, and you can still lose because someone else got luckier and was offered a better set of cards. 

If that isn't bad enough, recall the set of abilities you are able to encounter is already determined by RNG, so you don't have to deal with one layer of randomness when fighting others, you have to deal with two. Per player. You have to not only unlock cards that are strong enough and synergize with each other but also make sure that you find them when playing and that your enemies don't have a stronger combo.

Upside Showdown tries to appeal to both the Brawl Stars audience and the roguelite audience, and somehow it does neither. Brawl Stars players seek a game of mechanical skill---but is it really skilled if your enemy who has twice your hitpoints and twice your damage kills you? Roguelite players seek a game that rewards good decision-making---but it doesn't matter how good the choices you make are if your enemy has triple your stats.

# Part 3: What Makes Roguelites Fun

I touched on this a bit in part 2, but fundamentally, what makes roguelites fun is the decision making. Roguelites give the player some subset of options and the player makes their choice from that. Good choices are rewarded with synergy and stronger builds that allow the player to win fights more easily. Bad choices are punished when the player isn't strong enough to keep up with the enemies.

Thus, every good roguelite makes sure that the player has a lot of freedom. Perhaps the game is mostly random, but the game usually finds some way to allow the player to mitigate that randomness to some extent. Slay the Spire allows the player to choose their path, thus dictating when they fight, when they upgrade, when they get relics, and when they get a shop. Balatro allows players to reroll the shop to give more possible options of jokers and cards and gives consumable items that the player can use to permanently modify their deck in certain ways. Roguelites, while partially RNG-based, must also make sure that the player has *some* agency, some way to reduce randomness, so that they can win.

Brawl Stars does no such thing. In your entire run, you are offered five decisions, and each decision has only three options. It doesn't appear that you can reroll the options either---you just have to take what you get and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no path to change what you can do, no reroll to give you new choices, no ban to ensure that you can't see a certain upgrade. And again, the abilities that you can find in a run aren't even chosen by you; they're chosen by a random card pack. So the player has barely any freedom to choose their build and they're almost entirely at the mercy of RNG, which is just not fun.

# Conclusion

I have two proposed solutions to these problems.

If Brawl Stars wants to keep the mode as PvP, make the unlock system guaranteed. Instead of card packs, make it a shop where players can buy exactly what card they want using waffles. Or make it so that card packs drop the same rewards every time, fixed. Find some way to level the playing field so that all players have the same unlocks.

They can also make it so that the player faces some boss fight instead of players. We just got a great series of bosses in the Halloween event, with some fine-tuning and different difficulties we could have players face these bosses instead. The RNG-based unlocks would also be less of a problem because the players now know what they're fighting and can prepare for them.

In both cases, GIVE THE PLAYER MORE CHOICE!!! This is the big one. Give the player more freedom. I propose the following: instead of five events, make it ten events, and at each event, give the player a choice. They can fight to pick one of three cards (but risk elimination), upgrade one of their cards to make the effect more powerful, or replace an existing card with a random new card. The tenth event is forced to be a fight. The goal of this system is to give the player more choices over a longer period of time and give them more freedom as well as add a sort of risk-reward dynamic where the player can choose a fight, which risks elimination, but also gives a greater reward. This makes the roguelite mechanic of the game more fun---it gives the player more freedom, rewards good decision making, and adds a component of risk and reward.

Any feedback on this post is greatly appreciated. It's my first time posting in this sub and I'd like to see what everyone thinks of this.

1og5zkb,How to stop bad randoms,"This might sound super silly, but I’ve had an idea on how to stop bad randoms. Brawl Stars is obviously a game for lords, and a large percentage of its fan base is children. Those children are the ones who don’t know how to draft, don’t understand synergies and are overall the ones picking Edgar on every map. 

When you create your account, you have to input your age. There is obviously a large amount of people who lie about their age, but I really doubt the super young ones know how to do that. Have difficult would it be to split the servers in half, between the ages of +16 and U16 or something like that. I feel like that is a very small change that could have a huge impact on everyone’s overall enjoyment of the game.

 It would also help with balancing because it would be easier to see what actual pros and good players want and need and currently use u stead of the current majority of children.

1ogck1k,XP Doublers Rework Concept,"The problem with XP Doublers now is that the number of doublers you have now essentially equals to the number of XPs you'll get eventually. So say for example you own 1000 XP Doublers, eventually after they are used up you earn 1000 more XPs. So why don't they just give you the XP directly in the first place?

My rework concept is to make the XP Doubler count as number of matches they'll be activating. For example after the rework you have 5 XP Doublers, so for the upcoming 5 matches, all XP earned including quests will be doubled. This will make XP Doublers more rewarding and also encourage players to finish quests.

1oekdmt,"Brawl Stars needs to add a drafting assistant, there are becoming too many brawlers and the average player has no idea how to draft.","So, recently it feels like draft has more impact than it ever has in brawl stars. With how many broken brawlers and hypercharges are in the game currently, it often can feel like you lost the game from the draft screen. This is largely because randoms have no idea how to draft.

  
I suggest adding a drafting assistant to the game. How would it function? By identifying what brawlers the enemy have chosen, it will then suggest you a pick that would potentially counter that brawler. Examples:

1. Lets say you're first pick, it's hard for the drafting assistant to give any suggestion due to being the first pick, so maybe it just suggests brawlers that are generally good in the mode you are playing.

2. Lets say you're second pick after the first brawler has been chosen, lets say they picked an assassin, well it will suggest a brawler good at dealing with assassins, maybe tanks or a brawler like Otis.

3. The final scenario is whenever I feel like a drafting assistant is the most necessary, and that is when you are final pick. The final pick often can completely decide a game, so it's one of the most important. Lets say the enemy has drafted two tanks, the drafting assistant will tell you the two brawlers that are tanks that they have selected, and that you should pick a tank counter, which it would suggest tank counters like Griff or Corde.

Now I know a lot of people don't have a lot of brawlers, though I do think that everybody in mythic has at least 12 brawlers (hopefully all from different classes). I know brawlstars would likely never implement this, but it's just been getting more and more frustrating to play ranked considering over half of the games are decided from the drafting screen. Most players have no clue how to draft and just pick whatever they want on a whim. I guess this drafting assistant may not change that, but it may make some people change their picks.

1ofw24n,Opinions on the Brawl Talk?,"in my opinion, i think this might help revive the game. My top 3 things are

3: XP doublers for quests, do i even need to explain? Everyone wanted this!


HM: the new trio game modes. Although i dont think gem grab will work super well, i have more faith in trio wipeout, which i think will be in my top game modes OAT.

2: the new random 6 wins = 6 rewards (that can differ)! Its something i enjoy from this event, so seeing it stay with some different things, INCLUDING different boxes, is something i like, and honestly, you cant complain about rewards! I am also wondering what the mech box is


HM 2: Mega quests. Really worth it IMO. Good rewards, for some quests you can grind through. I enjoy this!

1: my favorite thing is the upside down showdown! i personally like all the power ups (for example mutations and angel powers), but the only thing that i didnt like was that it sometimes forced you to play other game modes when you didnt feel like playing with the powers.

Upside down showdown works because normal showdown still exists, and the powers work best in showdown. 

Another thing thats cool is that its esentially the idea for powers for mutations and angels/demons combined.

1ofbyri,"In your opinion, can a simple brawlers like Jacky still demand the minimum skill?","I see a lot of people criticizing Jacky because of her gameplay style which basically boils down to walking straight and destroying everything like an out of control bullet train. I don't really mind it and I don't think she's toxic, since she's an off-meta brawler who's easy to deal with most of the time. But there's something about her in terms of her skill floor and skill ceiling. Since simpler brawlers tend to be easier to understand and have more rigid mechanics, they will require more basic skills related to the player rather than their own mechanics such as game sense, positioning and dodging, unlike more complex brawlers like kaze who has a whole synergy in relation to her modes and build (gadgets and star powers). Jacky goes against all of this as she only has a single viable build and both her main attacks and supers are quite simple and similar, and there's really no problem with that after all she's a super rare, she can't be difficult to understand since she is a brawler unlocked at the beginning of the game by beginner players. She's only viable on two types of map (closed and bushy) and her hypercharge doesn't do much besides make her better at what she already was: pushing and pressuring. But the fact that she is a simple push tank makes her a challenging brawler to balance, as she has no place at the top of the meta precisely because she is easy to play and making her too strong would make the meta toxic and therefore making her hateful. It's a similar case to shelly, who is the starting brawler and can't get too strong since her mechanics are too simple and would turn the meta upside down, since anyone can get used to her gameplay in no time and 100% of players have her unlocked. Homever, Jacky is a noob stomper, she is strong against beginners, but she also has her cons, since her good matchups are impossible to lose and her bad matchups are impossible to win (surge, rico, spike, frank, el primo, bull, etc). And like I said, she's a balanced brawler, and her stats are relatively ok (aside from the unnecessary health nerf, but we didn't talk about that).

So my question still is: can jacky still demand skill?",https://i.redd.it/ozdxuwsc25xf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ofbyri/in_your_opinion_can_a_simple_brawlers_like_jacky/,6,1761346559.0,image,media\images\1ofbyri.jpeg,Discussion,Neutral/Other,"The user engages in a long, analytical discussion about the Brawler Jacky, questioning her skill requirements and balance within the game.

The new skins are very MID (mechas as well), they haven’t added a big change to the game as they promised (I mean c’mon, 6 dog water rewards instead of 3 isn’t that much of a deal). Also, the hypercharge change does completely nothing? I mean I use Kenji’s hyper not because I want some stats, but because I want a pull. The returning boxes thing is as bad, the whole event spirit is completely gone from them and idk how to bring it back. I mean seriously, mega and omega quests aren’t that exciting, because regular pass is more than enough to get all the rewards. Rogue like mode is also meh RNG based thing, like hypercharge events. 

The example of good game development is clash games. CR is not implementing anything new, but reworking old stuff so it feels fresh and modern. CoC on the other hand tries to maintain interest by buffing old systems and adding small stuff that changes the game (even the craft defenses are valuable)

And the new brawler… is just awful. ANOTHER MYTHIC ASSASIN!!! 

I guess what I mean to say is, that if the Supercell won’t start fixing things and actually caring about the game, then it probably won’t have a future.

What’s ur opinions on that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og0f2t/isnt_the_new_update_kinda_bad/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1og0f2t/isnt_the_new_update_kinda_bad/,0,1761420741.0,text_only,,Feedback/Rant,Anger,"The user is expressing strong anger and frustration with the new update and the perceived overall decline of Brawl Stars.

Day 2: Door 4 - seems to be the one with the hypercharge drop, it will allow everyone to get a new boost for winning and keep the hype (not a punch);

Day 3: Door 9 or 17 - Door 17 seems to be the one with the 10 sushis, but in a scenario that the door 2 don't give us the skin probably door 9 is the second guess for having it;

Day 4: Door 10 - this one looks so mysterious and I think it'll be the one with the ultratrophy box

Day 8: Doors 8, 13 and 6 - Doors 13 and 6 need to be open in the last day so people who already have all brawlers can use it to unlock Ziggy, door 8 seems to be a good one too so it's a good bet.

1of80t7,Im quiting this game.,"After one an half year, hitting 50k trophies, I decided to quit this game because it started to make no sense. This will be a long post.

  
First of al nothing makes sense in this game. Support brawlers can assasinate you from the bushes (Kit),  deal thousands of damage from other side of the map (Byron), tank absolutely all the hyperchages of damage dealers (poco). 

Tanks can ambush  easily from the bushes (Frank), assasinate just by walking towards you (Bibi), control the area with spamming basic attack (Meg).

Throwers are more or less balanced, if you dont question why a thrower has a marksmans range (Grom), a damage dealer's damage (L&L).

Marksmans, who are supposed to be deadly at range and weak at close combat can kill you when you get close also. Nani just blasts you with his super, Bea can two-shot you with her basic attacks etc etc. Plus, what is the purpose of assasins if almost all of the markmans have gadget to avoid them. Piper, Brock and other I cant care to count.  Not even mentioning area controllers like EMZ and Genie.

There are other things that doesnt make sense and I will try to list the ones I remember.

Byron and Gus. Support brawlers with a marksman's range and thrower's bullet width. What is the logic behind them? Like really? They can hit every bullet with ease and they deal stupid damage.

Jessie. Once she placesa turret, good luck she wil cycle endlessly and you wont even be dreaming of killling the turret with close range brawler, yet alone taking her down.

Shade. I think shade should start the match with hypercharge ready, cuz what? it tooks him 3 seconds to recharge it anyway so why bother?

Lou. Absolute madness. Insane range, freeze after 5 succesfull bullet pieces, cover the half of the map with super? Were developers drunk when they designed this?

Piper. If it makes sense to give a brawler 4k+ damage with basic attack at max range, it should also deal 100 damage at best at close range. Oh and, give her automatic aiming gadget? Sure, let one brawler deal 8k+ damage in 2 seconds. Maybe you were lucky enough to get close to her. Well sucks to be you, other gadget pushes you two kilometers away, makinsure Piper has enough time to reload and wreck you. I take back what I said about Lou. Developers were passed out when the creation of Piper was on process.

R-T. Again insane range, enough damage, and when you get close, get wrecked by a weird area attack that would put Jacky to shame.

Rico. Okay I can understand that a brawler with bouncing bullets, perfect for killing targets behind walls. But why the f do they deal more damage when they bounce? Being able to bounc them is OP enough, shouldnt it be balanced with a penalty? Unbeliavable.

Tara. Is there even a way to dodge her super attack? Or survive it?

EMZ and Bo. Area controllers shouldnt be able to deal this much damage and tank this much damage. Is this too much to expect?

Sprout. First time I played against Sprout I thought enemy team is cheating. What the F do you mean bullets are randomly jumping around. What is the purpose of aiming then? Just spam the basic attack and voila. 

Jae-Jong. Another support brawler that you can roam the map without fear. For some reason it runs almost as fast as Max, for some reason his attacks are piercing the targets. For some reaon this brawlers is supposed to make sense.

Griff. Not even Chester can deal 10k damage in a single shot. It can literally one-shot more than 90% of the brawlers with its super attack. Mind you this brawler is a area controller.

Lumi. Now imagine Colt with more bullet width, more damage, more area control and absolutely zero reload speed. There you go, make sense of it.

Berry. I understand recharging super by healing your friends. This is what support is for. But recharhing it while healing yourself? How does that make sense? If you have a wall to hie behind, you are basically immortal.

Kaze. It charges its super and hyper charge so easily, you dont even have to use basic attack. Just blow the screen and Kaze will start jumping on enemies with its ninja form. Easy.

And many others I don't care to mention. Long story short, Brawl Stars make no sense. So I quit before they can annoy me with another broken brawler that they will nerf to the groun once they made the cash. Im talking to you Alli.

Anyway, if you have other game suggestions please hit me up.

Again sorry for the long post. 

Take care everyone.

1oivnhr,random brawler idea,"I wanted to create a brawler that's a thrower but also has a very aggressive play style, so here's my attempt. He might be somewhat overpowered so I apologize in advance but this is my best attempt:

Name: Nade

Brawler type: Artillery 

Description: 
Nade is a veteran. Or at least that's what he likes to think. Hundreds of applications to join the military, and not one has been accepted... 



Stats (power level 11):

Health: 5000

Movement speed: Normal

Main attack: Grenade Toss

Nade throws a grenade, dealing explosion damage upon contact with a surface. Grenades also have shrapnel,  dealing damage past the explosion range. Nade can also use the explosion of the grenades to propel himself very far, at the cost of 500 health. Nade can attack while airborne.

Explosion damage: 2500

Shrapnel damage: 200 x 4

Range: Long

Reload speed: Very Fast

Ammo count: 1

Explosion launch distance: 8 tiles 



Super: Supply Drop

Nade calls in a supply drop, falling from the sky and upon landing breaks open, dealing 2000 damage to nearby enemies and dropping three MRE rations. Upon contact, each MRE ration heals him and friendly brawlers for 33% of their max health. Many MRE rations can be out at once, as long as Nade can get multiple supers. 

Super range: Very long

Damage to charge super: 10000



Special gears: Extra shrapnel

Each grenade has 4 extra shards of shrapnel 



Gadgets:

Gadget #1: Smoke Grenade 

Nade's next attack throws a smoke grenade instead of a regular grenade, which deals no damage but covers a large area in smoke, which conceals him and his team from enemy brawlers for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 20 seconds.

Gadget #2: Artillery Arm

Nade's next attack has its range, damage, and explosion radius increased by 50%. It also propels him twice as far.

Cooldown: 17 seconds.



Star powers: 

Star power #1: Pocket Rations

Every 3 seconds, Nade consumes a ration from his pocket, healing 33% of his max health.

Star power #2: Explosive Vest

When Nade's health drops below 50%, his vest explodes, dealing 3000 damage to enemy brawlers and knocking them back. 

Hypercharge: 

Nade's super now drops 6 rations instead of only 3. Each ration heals 50% instead of 33%, and can overheal up to 6000. Each ration also boosts damage and speed by +10% for 10 seconds, which can stack with other rations.

Damage to charge hyper: 30000 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oivnhr/random_brawler_idea/,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1oivnhr/random_brawler_idea/,0,1761713302.0,text_only,,Art/Concept,Neutral/Other,"The user is presenting a detailed concept for a new Brawler, 'Nade', including its stats, abilities, and lore.

1oirt47,Mina is still so strong,"The recent nerfs are a good direction but missplaced. The patch notes are correct in calling her broken. She went from 8.8k damage in a burst to 8.4 in a burst and her ult and gadgets take a little longer to charge. I hostly think the biggest problem with the characters balance is her survivability. She has 8.2k health with a stu ult worth of movement on every basic attack. I think the answer here is a health nerf. Her damage is fine but take her max health down to something around 6k or maybe just a little more. I really think this would be better. Right now shes just not really approachable by dives because she has a nice health pool and great mobility to get away in time before dying while killing the dive with a burst of 8k damage (not even mentioning the knockup ult), and shes terrible for ranged brawlers because she can dodge ever projectile on reaction with a basic attack side step, hitting you while you cant hit her(along with a gadget that just flat out blocks projectiles). I would pretty a squishier health pool to reduced movement or increase basic attack cooldown cause i think her movement mechanics are fun. Its just the movement while being tanky and high damage doesnt feel good to play against at all

1ojw2rn,Theory: Manga Kenji could be behind the 1 Gem Door,"Evidence explanation:

Oni Kenji is a Hypercharge skin related to purple flame energy, Hypercharge, and green flame energy, Wasabi Power. Either by coincidence or on purpose, these are also the colors of the Gem Grab Gems and Paid Gems respectively. 

Purple Gems are known to be related to superpowers within Starr Park lore and can cause aggression. Wasabi Powers in the manga can turn the entities who eat the powered Wasabi it into Yokai, implying these contain green Gem powder considering the stuff purple Gems can do within Starr Park lore. It seems to me that the different-colored Gems provide different mutations, with purple Gems Hypercharging people while green Gems turn people into different versions of themselves, which could even be skins. And guess what high-rarity skins can only be bought with, including Hypercharge skins on certain occasions? Green Gems. Within the Manga, Oni Kenji’s flame-tattoo is actually Cursed Kenji’s green amulet that can break, which could be made out of green Gems.

In a previous community event related to completing Quests, Knight Doug was able to be obtained practically for free. By “purchasing” a chain of offers by using the 1 free Gem, Knight Doug could be obtained with 1 Gold.

My theory is that none of the doors truly contain Manga Kenji. Instead, we have to “free” him by opening up the door that gives us only 1 Gem and then by purchasing a chain of offers with this 1 Gem we can claim him basically for free, basically repeating what they did with Knight Doug.",https://i.redd.it/9f1q11z588yf1.jpeg,/r/Brawlstars/comments/1ojw2rn/theory_manga_kenji_could_be_behind_the_1_gem_door/,40,1761820256.0,image,media\images\1ojw2rn.jpeg,Discussion,Neutral/Other,"The user is presenting a detailed theory about how a specific in-game element (Manga Kenji) might be obtained, drawing connections between various lore elements, past events, and game mechanics.

How about I remind everyone something. Look at this in-game tip:

>Use Pins and sprays in-game to express ***your*** emotions.

Do you remember the true meaning of pins? Showing **YOUR OWN** emotions and how YOU feel about the situation.

Do we intentionally use happy pins when only someone else is happy? 

Obviously, we don't. We use them to show that **we** are happy, not others. Then why for the clown pin people think that it implies literally the opposite?

That also spreads to monkey pins. They reference the old phrase ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" (basically, don't think or do evil things). But these are literally used for evil, ""to show that enemy is a monkey"".

With this in mind, if you use clown pin, then **you** feel like a clown. If you use monkey pin, it would depend on the gesture (you don't wanna see/hear/speak).

1ojeoke,New brawler idea for an aggressive thrower,"I got bored and decided to create an idea for a new brawler. There isn't really a dedicated aggressive thrower so I decided to make one. Forgive me if this brawler is too op 💔

Name: Nihil

Brawler type: Artillery 

Description: 
Nihil is a veteran. Or at least that's what he likes to think. Hundreds of applications to join the military, and not one has been accepted... 



Stats (power level 11):

Health: 5000

Movement speed: Fast

Main attack: Grenade Toss

Nihil throws a grenade, dealing explosion damage upon contact with a surface. Grenades also have shrapnel, potentially dealing extra damage within explosion range. Nihil can also use the explosion of the grenades to propel himself very far, at the cost of 500 health. Nihil can attack while airborne.

Explosion damage: 2250

Shrapnel damage: 250 x 6

Range: Long

Reload speed: Very Fast

Ammo count: 3

Explosion launch distance: 10 tiles 



Super: Supply Drop

Nihil calls in a supply drop, falling from the sky and upon landing breaks open, dealing 2000 damage to nearby enemies and dropping three MRE rations. Upon contact, each MRE ration heals Nihil for 50% of his max health and friendly brawlers for 33% of their max health. Many MRE rations can be out at once, as long as Nihil can get multiple supers. 

Super range: Very long

Damage to charge super: 8000



Special gears: Extra Shrapnel

Each grenade has 4 extra shards of shrapnel 



Gadgets:

Gadget #1: Smoke Grenade 

Nihil's next attack throws a smoke grenade instead of a regular grenade, which deals no damage but covers a large area in smoke, which conceals him and his team from enemy brawlers for 5 seconds.

Cooldown: 20 seconds.

Gadget #2: Artillery Arm

Nihil's next attack has its range, damage, and explosion radius increased by 50%. It also propels him twice as far.

Cooldown: 15 seconds.



Star powers: 

Star power #1: Pocket Rations

Every 3 seconds, Nihil consumes a ration from his pocket, healing 50% of his max health.

Star power #2: Explosive Vest

When Nihil's health drops below 50%, his vest explodes, dealing 4000 damage to nearby enemy brawlers and knocking them back. 

Hypercharge: Rational Rationing

Nihil's super now drops 6 rations instead of only 3. Each ration heals twice as much, and they can overheal up to 6000. Each ration also boosts damage and speed by +10% for 8 seconds, which can stack with other rations.

Damage to charge hyper: 30000

1ojh2ur,Making Lawrie playable - 3 different ways,"In current state, Lawrie is technically a pet, which doesn't really make sense.

I'm aware that making Lawrie playable is not really a big priority for the devs, however...

I present to you 3 ways in which Larry and Lawrie could be reworked. Each way rework the brawler from different angle and each way has its pros and cons.



**I - complete rework**

There are a lot of ideas of a complete rework for the twins and there are a lot of good ideas out there. However I'll describe only one of them ('m also pretty sure somebody already came up with similar idea):

In the beginning both twins spawn, but Larry is controlled by the player. If both twins are present, using super will switch the control between twins. When only one twin is present, super will now spawn the other twin (just like now). When player-controlled twin is defeated, control is switched to the twin that is alive.

The current gadgets, star-powers and hypercharge would probably also have to be reworked to match the new mechanics.

*Pros:*

\- the rework will make the twins much more interesting and unique. In the current state, twins are extremly similar to Juju when it comes to basic mechanics (they're both spawner throwers)

*Cons:*

\- the rework would be time-consuming,

\- Larry and Lawrie would probably had their rarity changed (most likely to Legendary or Ultra Legendary), which would increase the cost of unlocking them dramatically.



**II - reworking ""Swap"" gadget**

At the current state, ""Swap"" gadget only swaps the weapons, but I feel like this could be brought step further and actually make that player actually switches control to the other twin.

This is also one of the most popular ideas, brought up by community.

*Pros:*

\- probably the most simple change, because I feel like current ""Swap"" gadget is like already halfway there. I think gadget cooldown wouldn't even need to be changed,

\- would make the ""Swap"" gadget more appealing and make choice between two gadgets slightly more difficult (currently, the ""Swap"" gadget is much worse than the second gadget),

\- the rarity of twins wouldn't need to be changed, because gadgets usually don't reflect the complexity and rarity of the brawler.

*Cons:*

\- in order to have playable Lawrie, you cannot use the second gadget,

\- not really compatible with star powers.



**III - adding the mythic gear**

Mythic gear: if Larry is defeated but Lawrie is on the map, player switches control to Lawrie. If Larry reappear  on the map, player's control instantly switches back to Larry.

*Pros:*

\- nothing needs to be changed in the twins current mechanics,

\- twins don't have a mythic gear yet, so the would get one.

*Cons:*

\- for the playable Lawrie, you would need to sacrifice one gear slot,

\- would kinda defeat the purpose of the ""Swap"" gadget.

1ok574e,"Current starr road is flawed, here how to fix it.","So as of now and since 2022 the STARR ROAD is something that is yes is still better than pure gambling, but still flawed, what do i mean by that, pretty simple. It goes the way the devs want you to go. Its always you start with shelly get nita then bull colt rosa poco the super rare then you have to choose beetween bo and emz. Everyone have the same starr road and i find that honestly boring especially when you look at how the chromatic brawler were handled with the chroma credits.....wait but THATS IT 

Let me introduce you to the STARR PATH 

What is the Starr Path you might ask? Pretty simple little Tomar 

The Starr Path is your path to be, well....a raising starr and for that youll need brawler for that but why taking the same path as all the other you are you and they are they.

Enough foreplay, the Starr Path would be a way to unlock brawler the way we want to do, because as of now as i stated its the same path for everyone and lets say you want juju but are a f2p, you have to luck or to wait many many MANYYYY well even too many brawler and when you look at how the end of the road is looking all red mythic mythic mythic its just tasteless. The starrpath could work like the chromatic brawler were handle, an old brawler like leon would take lets say 3 mythic and 5 epic on your account to be able to choose him, spike, or crow 

As for a more recent uni legendary such as Kenji (he is in door 6, colette told me), youd need 6 mythic and 10 epics to or lets say 5 mythic and 7 epics and preferably a legendary or 2 before. It would let people, casual, new or returning player to have theyre own choice have theyre own....path 

And it also help the youtubers so they can make video such as ""top 10 brawler to prioritize on the starr path season 56""

1okoybu,Title: Shop improvement suggestion,"Subject: Suggestion to simplify and reorganize the in-game shop
Hey! I wanted to share a small but important suggestion about the in-game shop.

Right now, the shop feels overloaded with too many repeating or unnecessary sections. For example, the Battle Pass and Pro Pass purchase tabs don’t really need to be there — they already exist in the Battle Pass screen and in the Ranked section. It just makes the shop look messy and harder to navigate.

Also, the amount of separate skin offers is overwhelming. It would be much cleaner if skins appeared only in their respective brawler or collection catalogs — with small discount tags or event markers when needed — instead of taking up extra space in the main shop.

Overall, the shop would look much more organized, and players could find what they want faster. I think many players would really appreciate this change.

1ombnb1,This Guy Doesn't Care About the Safety of the Brawl Community (Read Description),"So, the Starfield Offline Festival in Korea had a promotion yesterday (I had to repost because this was never checked) where attendees could get a bunch of Brawl Stars merch (really cute btw, please make a global shop) and other things. As a reward for attending the event, they had QR codes for Street Shade, Mecha Finx, Persephone Lumi, and Mecha Mortis (about 1500 uses each). Well, someone (I won't mention who just so that no further harassment meets them in case people are awful) decided to be kind enough to share the link with some in this person's Discord server. For the first skin it was fine, but then this guy caught wind of it and alerted everyone on his Twitter...

Commence the rush of hundreds and thousands of new members (who are clearly immature and probably not even old enough to be on Discord or Twitter) demanding for the link, saying slurs in chat, and many other awful things. The time comes and they post the next link. Link meets its limit.

I left the server after being overwhelmed by the wave of newbies. It was only moments later I found out the person received death threats and had to private their Twitter. This page did not address any of that and decided to post this tweet right after. After discussing with some members in the KTK Discord about the incident, I come to find out that DEATH THREATS are not an INSTA BAN, but a STRIKE. Additionally, this page does not care about keeping a safe community, and they rather would hit 45k members than ensure the safety of others.

Skin ideas: Finx HC skin, Pharaoh bibi, mummified kaze, desert explorer moe, horus crow, anubis berry, and Osiris Ali.

1olwe5z,Matchmaking should account for brawler level to an extent,"The gap in power between a level 7/8 brawler and a level 11 one is too wide.

But doing any of the character based quests is too time consuming as you effectively have to camp and hope a level 11 doesn’t come by where you can’t meaningfully fight back or make an escape.

I know they reworked everything with a sort of sliding scale between individual brawler trophies and overall account trophies. But I feel like there should be some kind of cap (max 2 levels up or down from your brawler’s level).

1olnrnl,Quitting after 4 years,"I have been playing brawl stars since 2021. I really enjoy it but I have decided to quit due to various frustrations I have with the game, and it just keeps getting worse. I don't care about events, boxes, star drops or any other cosmetics or monetary changes. The core gameplay was enough to keep me in. 

I was never particularly a strong player but I have reached a point where I lose 5 games before winning one no matter which mode I play. I reached mythic every season in ranked previously but I wasn't able to pass diamond for the last 2 seasons. 4 years and I don't have a single 1000 trophy brawler. Now you might think I'm leaving because I am just bad at playing. That is not the case. I am a star player 4 out of 5 matches I lose. In ranked, it's just bad teammates straight up picking not so good brawlers. In ladder, there is so much griefing now. Before writing this tweet, I lost 4 matches in a row because one teammate just went offline in all the matches. To make the matters worse, I kept getting matched with him repeatedly, and this is not the first time this has happened. I really wish there was a report button in ladder as there is in ranked. You might say play showdown but we all know what's up with it.

Now this frustration is probably I just don't have any friends who play brawl. I am forced to play with randoms and it just isn't working out. I have decided to quit as of now, maybe I'll come back, maybe not. 

I probably just suck but I tried.

1olmb1t,A crazy turn of events,"Hey, so I'm the guy that made that ""stupid"" theory about door 18. This post is a bit of an apology but it isn't meant to be deep or serious, it's still a mobile game at the end of the day and it's not like I committed a crime. I just wanted to talk a bit about the discourse happening after everyone got 1 coin.

So for starters, I'm sorry that door 18 got voted. I definitely was a big reason we got one of the worst rewards in the event. People were right when I looked into things too closely. Maybe the rewards are random, or maybe only door 2 and 13 were random so far, and I just tricked people into voting the wrong.

I also apologize if I was a bit egotistical. In the post about updating my theory(where I acknowledged about door 16 also having eyebrows, so don't say that I straight up ignored the information, I still had the Hypercharge flame evidence, it just didn't get as much traction as my initial post) I said ""you guys probably know me as the door 18 has manga kenji guy"", and I'd be lying if I said that the praising I got and getting featured in Brawl Reflex's video didn't boost my ego, it definitely did. So I apologize about that because some of you probably found it as self glaze. 

But I do not regret making it, I like listening to crazy theories that are probably far fetched. I often watch Alex Bale  and game theory on YouTube. 

I stand my ground when I say that while yes I influenced it, it was still a theory and you guys were entitled to your own opinion. Agree with it or disagree with it, I didn't care. I just wanted to add something to the table after door 2 didn't have manga kenji since everyone wanted that thing. If you voted it, it was because you believed the theory with me, so don't act like you didn't have a hand in it. I acknowledge that I started, but you have to acknowledge the people that voted for it and spread the word.

Now sorry if it sounds like I'm venting, but I don't believe my theory is dumber than other peoples' theories. Door 5 looks like a Japanese Tori gate, but it also looks like an entrance to a mine(it has rocks covering which connects more with mining and anything Japanese), and the white hand looks like a skeleton hand. Door 10 has two eyes, so it's Kenji, but Starr drops also have two eyes, and the entrance is covered with the letter S(Starr drops start with the letter S). Door 7 has Kenji's eyes, it also has a bat and it's color scheme is purple(default mortis has a similar color scheme). Admit it, you'll say it's just as stupid as my theory IF it turned out to be wrong.

Lastly, I feel like almost nobody here actually has an opinion they truly believe in. Before majority people were agreeing with me, now majority are bullshitting my theory because it was wrong. I feel people did agree, but didn't want to be seen as stupid by the people who disagreed, so they just pretend they didn't vote for it and just blame it on me or Reflex. 

By the way, door 2 and door 13 was as much of a wrong guess as mine imo, people just weren't mad because it has a good reward, while my guess had a bad reward. It definitely wouldn't be as hated if it had 1k coins or something better.

The only thing thats sorta hard to deal with is the ult but even that can be countered by outranging her ult gain zone (not as many brawlers can do that but still a decent amount).

1olk3zw,Why door no.17 WILL contain the Manga Kenji skin #scarydoors #brawlstars,"Let me explain:
You can see that the vending machine door has 12 buttons, and Kenji is the 12th legendary brawler released in the game. Not only that but this vending machine hints that it was Rico's ex girlfriend, and Rico is the 5th released super rare brawler, so if you subtract 5 to 17, which is the door number (17 - 5), it equals to 12, which relates again to Kenji coincidentally being the 12th released legendary brawler. 

But you can also see a heart in the vending machine, if you count the contents of the vending machine until the heart, it'll be 4, which is also the number of stubble hair in Kenji's face, but that's not all the Heart signifies love, and Kenji loves Kaze, Kaze was released in May of 2025, and Kenji was released in September 2024, if you look closely of you subtracted the 9th month to the 5th month (9 - 5) it equals to 4, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED AT, but we can go deeper. The gap between Kenji and Kaze is 9 months apart, it meaning the amount of Kenji skin (Default Kenji, Fruit Samurai Kenji, Hebi Kenji, Mamushi Kenji, Aodaisho Kenji, Cursed Kenji, Oni Kenji, Kizu Kenji, and the 9th one being the MANGA KENJI).

But we can go even deeper. With the appearance of the vending machine, you can see the hole of the cracked glass slightly silhouetting the hypercharge form of Oni Kenji, specifically the bushy hair of its form, but that's not only the hint, the dispenser hole has an arrow symbol on it, and it seems it's 2 arrows on it, the 2 meaning the two swords Kenji is holding in his hypercharge form.

But we can go even deeper, the color of the purple vending machine is the hex code #8d4db8, which splits into three two-character hex bytes.
8d in hex: 8 * 16 + d(=13) = 128 + 13 = 141.
4d in hex: 4 * 16 + d(=13) = 64 + 13 = 77.
b8 in hex: b(=11) * 16 + 8 = 176 + 8 = 184.
So in RGB it'll be 141, 77, 184. Now look closely, because if you multiply the red by the green (141 * 77), you get 10,857. Now, what happens when you divide that by the blue (10,857 ÷ 184)? You get 59.02, which is eerily close to 60,and  if you subtract that 60 from the red channel (141 - 60), you land on 81, and if you take that 8+1, you get 9, which is September, the very month Kenji was released. Coincidence? Hell no.
Now take the blue channel and divide it by the green channel(141 ÷ 77) and you get 2.389, and when you add the digits together (2+3+8+9), you get 22, which, if you look at the calendar grid of September 2024,  is just FOUR, FOUR days before Kenji’s actual release date, September 26, symbolizing the heart in the vending machine.
And when you take every number in the hex (8, 13, 4, 13, 11, and 8, because “d”=13 and “b”=11), and just sum them straight, you get 58. Now (5+8 = 13), and (1+3 = 4), Which again, symbolizing the placement of the heart in the vending machine.

But even with all this in mind, I actually felt THAT THIS IS the door leading to Manga Kenji. Since during the time Oct 31, 2025, exactly in 1:36 AM whilst I was asleep, I felt my armpit hair follicles get goosebumps, why did that happen you ask? Well, that might actually signaled me to 17, why? Well If you align the digits of October 31, 2025, 01:36 AM like coordinates (10 | 31 | 25 | 01 | 36), and sum them straight (10 + 31 + 25 + 1 + 36), you get the number 103. Subtract the number of letters in “Friday” (6) and “October” (7), and what do you get? (103 - 13), equalling to 90. Divide that by the number of minutes past 1 AM (90 ÷ 36), and you get 2.5. 2.5 meaning (2 + 5) = 7, now add back the 1 of 1 AM, AND YOU GET 17, WHICH IS THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE DOOR THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR.

1olg70s,Can we get a shout-out to Kaze?,"This brawler is actually so fire tbh. 

She killed early access offers in a way since in the update after hers they announced they'd be changed. 

While she has been VERY strong since her release, she's not really been a toxic unfair oppressive brawler to complain about. 

I love how she is very good in the hands of a skilled player, but in the hands of someone who doesn't know her play style, she seems very weak. This makes it so she isn't over played like other assassins and skilled players can have their fun and we don't have to complain about her!

Gameplay wise, she's very fun and deserving of the ultra legendary rarity, whether or not we like the fact that rarity is in the game. Her mobility, unique supers, and playstyle is one of the most fun takes on assassins.. even though it is another one with invisibity and dash attacks it still feels new. 

The price tag is kinda.. there's no defending it. It's insane. Yeah while she's more dynamic than any other character I'm the game, and indeed does have more than a mythic and legendary combined MAYBE. 999 gems/5500 credits is wild. But hey in a niche scenario for those unlocking her it's like like a credit bank if you wanna switch to a new brawler!

1ol5qkw,Kit Rework,"WHY DO WE NEED THIS REWORK?

This rework is aimed at making Kit a Support/ Assassin because right now he's an Assassin/ Support.

Kit right now has too many assassin trait and not enough support traits: high movement speed, passive super charge, high burst damage (mostly in solo cuz of 1st SP), jump, invisibility even his HC is based on his assassin side, when his only support trait is his healing.

My first thought was to reduce damage and increase healing. That part was easy, lower basic damage from 2000 to 1200 that way he cant just burst you down with basic then jump and finish you off, i removed the damage for the super for that same reason. Then i added a heal of 2000 on landing on your ally to promote playing as a support. Kit continues to heal per second and damage per second when attached to an ally/enemy. And his stun stays.

Then came the harder balances, since kit is close range and deals so little damage i raised his HP from 6000 to 8200, and since he wont be bursting down enemies and will have to play more as a support, he gets the support trait (super charge when near allies).

Kit will also receive a 5% movement speed buff from 820 to 864 (as fast a Draco in dragon form).

Then comes this atrocious Gadget: Cardboard Box. Don’t worry i also reworked it. Cardboard Box becomes Purrfect Manicure: Kit gains 1000 damage to his basic attack and super for 4s, cooldown: 27s. This way he can become an assassin for a short time

There’s also his ridiculous SP: Power Hungry. And guys, I GOT YOU! Power Hungry becomes Kitty Soft Paws: Every 5s Kit’s next basic heals allies for 1200

His HC doesn’t get reworked but it gets an added effect for jumping on an ally: The ally Kit is attached to gets hypercharged for the duration of Kit’s HC

With these changes kit will have more of the Support traits: charge super near allies, instant healing, more healing, stun, and HC, while still having some assassin traits: fast movement speed, jump, and half of his HC.

HOW WILL KIT BE PLAYED?

Kit will be played as a “companion”, he can stick close to an assassin or tank, and stun enemies for his allies, or jump to them for some well needed healing. While his new Gadget can give him 1v1 capabilities to survive ambushes. He will be countered by control brawlers such as Jessy, Belle, Penny, while still being strong against marksmen with his stun and Gadget.

AFTERWORD.

There’s still work to be done with this Rework, such as the 2nd SP since he now has 2 defensive SPs, as well as some extra balancing cause I made up all these numbers myself and i have 0 experience with balancing.

Thank you for reading and for your upcoming feedback.

TLDR: Kit is now a Support Brawler with less overall damage and more healing, while getting a Gadget to retain some of his assassin capabilities.
